NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	-on sort of a makeshift [laughs] sort of a makeshift dock in the Bureau of Balance hangar.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So the three of you are currently sitting in a gondola, which is a fancy word for a little boat-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Sitting just across from you in another gondola is the Regulator crew.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You got Casey Fangbattle, you got Killian, and you got Boyland.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the Bureau of Balance base has moved through the night sky to the point where it is about 50 or 60 feet up, and about 30 feet sort of away from the laboratory [stress on O sounds] of Lucas Miller.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, whatever you wanna call it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So you’re gettin’ your first look at the lab now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Umm, and it’s kinda similar in scale to the Bureau of Balance lab-- it was kinda the prototype for- for the Bureau of Balance headquarters, it was kinda the prototype for the uh, the base you are currently stationed at.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Ummm, only it is… uh, as Lucas suggested, covered in pink crystal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and there’s kind of a gnarly winter storm happening outside?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And so there are these, like-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Griffin I’m sorry, gnarly as in… awesome or gnarly as in bad?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As in, like- well if you… like… the winter weather- if you- if you were hopin’ for a white-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	… Yeah, okay so if you were like snow-surfing they would be gnarly waves.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, there’s a lot of snow accumulating and uh, it’s actually caused some like, weird… like, uh-uh like spiky buildup?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	All around the exterior of- of the lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, you’re gonna need some, uh… grime… spray or	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	something for that.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But- but otherwise it looks kind of like the Bureau of… uh, Balance headquarters except it’s all sort of, uh, contained in a- a single gigantic dome.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, there’s no like outdoor quad area.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, there’s no, y’know, lush field of grass.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, it’s all just one sort of enclosed space.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, no seat warmers.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The Bureau of Balance headquarters benefited from… being the second iteration.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and uh, the- the, uh, Director walks up to the- the six of you in your two gondolas, and she says, uh	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Avi goes behind the- the Regulator's gondola and grabs onto the back of it and kinda just gives it like a running push off the edge–	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he forgets to let go, oh no!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	–of the dock.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Oh-no-bye-Avi's-dead.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He pushes the other gondola off and you watch it very slowly, very diagonally start moving through this winter storm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then Avi comes up and grabs the back of your gondola and says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you holler that into the abyss, you are pushed off of the- the Bureau of Balance hangar, and it's a bit terrifying?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Because now you're kind of freefalling?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Kind of sinking slowly?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Kind of floating?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Diagonally directly towards the laboratory.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And your- your movin- your target is this hole towards the top of the- the base- the skylight in the conservatory that Lucas mentioned in last week's episode that you probably forgot about.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you're kinda sinking towards this, you see Carey Fangbattle like standing up in the- in her gondola, just kinda like hootin' and hollerin', havin' a good ol' time.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But this- it's a pretty upsetting experience, this sinking.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus is actually on board.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And this descent lasts for, uh, for about a good 30 seconds or so, you're gettin' pretty close to the base.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But suddenly a squall from this winter storm presses up against your boat, and your boat starts a-rockin' and a-rollin' in the- in the sky.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And so does the Regulators' boat, you actually see them get a little bit more altitude, like this storm is like picking them up a little bit, sorta throwing off Avi's trajectory.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you approach the base, they've actually gained a lot of altitude.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you watch their gondola just kind of sail over this- this- [Clint starts laughing] this craggy sort of crystalline mountain range that has sort of built up as the snow collects on top of the base.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you watch them sort of disappear out of sight, while your own boat gets rocked around a little bit, but the trajectory doesn't get off too much, and you guys skid to a halt on top of the- on top of this lab's dome, kind of precariously teetering over the edge of this hole into the conservatory below.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As soon as your boat touches down, it turns to crystal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Not as soon as it does, there's a- kind of a slow transformation process, but it- it turns to crystal, and now like sort of how you're precariously positioned, it's actually.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's actually gettin' a little teeter-totter-y.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Well, Griffin, when it crystallizes, does it like, attach-	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No it's not fused, it's not fused no.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is just on there, and it's now covered in crystal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, yeah, you scoot very carefully to the back of the boat.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Is there a check I can make you do?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ohohkay, it's the- well the other two got you covered.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	They very dexterously back up to the back of the boat, and it comes down with a thud on the top of this solid base.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you are not in danger of falling in this hole.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	We solved the hole puzzle.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So yeah, you can see down in this hole now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's about- it's about a 30-foot drop down into the conservatory.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's a pretty cavernous room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it is completely- you- you can't see much from where you're at, but you can tell that this- this- this conservatory that was full of all these towering trees is- has been completely crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Can we rappel [pronounced like "rapple"] down the wall?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	YES	But I think- I think the problem is if the rope touches anything, it's gonna turn to crystal, right?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Can we uh robble-robble down the wall?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Like the Hamburglar does?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Could we use a grappel-ing hook?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	We could use a grappel-ing hook.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	All of the belongings that you have with you have been treated with the same stuff that went into your Null Suits, which I don't think I did a great job of explaining last week.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	It's basically like a space suit?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So you're wearing- you're wearing space suits.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, we- we do that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uhhhh, well, there's a- yeah there's a few like, rocky er, crystally outcroppings that you could tie a rope to.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It'll be pretty bad if you fall down this.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's a 40-foot drop.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Juice, do you have a spell you could use instead of using the rope?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Don't you have a feather duster or something?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, you have a- in your umbrella.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus, like a... a veteran gym teacher, goes down a rope just like, hand over hand, upside down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like, totally baller.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And reaches- reaches the crystalline forest floor below, and uh Magnus you see Taako and Merle just trying to do this, but they like, get two hands down and just like, both fall, and you shout, "Feather fall!"	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	One of the bosses.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It was either Cutman or Fallman or…	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, so yeah it safely enshrouds you and Merle in a silvery light as you slowly descend to the floor below.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So you've made it to the floor of the conservatory, and uh, it's full of these- It's basically a forest.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A artificial forest of these crystalline trees.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You're sort of surrounded, you can see two paths from where you landed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can see a path out to a pond that has also been crystallized, it's basically just a big pink clearing now and uh you can-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Everything in this room has been crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	In- and in the opposite direction you see a small, sort of clearing that almost looks likes a garden.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Has it been crystallized?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It has actually been crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Nothing.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like, let's just assume crystals are like air, and there's crystal, just like crystals crystals crystalscrystalscrystals.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Crystals, crystals everywhere.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Beautiful beautiful thing-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There's some ambient crinkle-tinkles.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's kinda like you're in like a Mario ice level, just like Mario 64.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	[crosstalk] Is there just a sprinkle of crinkle-tinkles?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And uhh, so anyway, there's a frozen garden.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There's some- there are actually some robots in it?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That are holding like various garden tools?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A watering can-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Crystallized robots?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	-some shears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, they've all been crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Everything.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's all crystal, baby.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And they're non-functioning I assume, right?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uhh, no they're actually screaming- No, yeah, they're not functioning.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	-they are dormant.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	 Should we attack 'em you think?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Should we kill 'em?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They're wrapped in...air, by which I mean crystals.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	YES	Ditto, do we have any kind of map or understanding of where to go from the conservatory?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Or did they just like, drop us off and figure that we'll… just like, intuit the way?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Uh, Lucas said that you need to move toward the interior of the base.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The conservatory is sort of on the outside.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	And you need to move toward the center.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Because that's where he is, in a medbay, holed up in a medbay, uh, that is not crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	And he needs you to get to him and	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	help him out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Dad falls over and a crystal goes through his eye socket.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[crosstalk] Alright, narrowly misses.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The secrets of the universe are exposed to you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Taako and Magnus, you make out across this uh, pond.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And you know that pond is made of crystal, right?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Across that pond you actually see something that doesn't have the same sort of… pink hue that everything else around you has.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You actually see a faint circle of white light?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you can see some metal inside of that circle that is just metal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is not crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Uh, I would like to move closer to that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As you guys move across this pond, that crinkle-tinkle that you've sorta been hearing the whole time you've been in this room, starts to get louder until it's almost like a consistent, like, hum.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And pretty soon that hum is forming like, a melody, it's forming music.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	and it's coming from like, it's not like there's a loudspeaker anywhere.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's just like coming- it's resonating through the crystal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you can hear it, and eventually on top of that hum, you hear a voice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And this voice sounds weird.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It sounds...it doesn't sound real.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It sounds synthetic, in a way.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And that voice sings the following:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you shout that, a- a rift appears in the air directly in front of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	-it's not very big.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's pretty small.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	'bout the size of a tennis ball.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Just kinda tears itself in the fabric of- of space.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And from it, a small light pops out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Small little ball of light pops out and drops into the pond that you're standing on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then, shit gets really really raw very very quickly.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It feels like there's an earthquake in this room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear the sound of trees just falling over and shattering as you- as they hit the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And shards of- of those trees are flying at you toward where this light dropped in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And from the pond that you're standing on, like a huge chunk of crystal comes flying up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Taako and Magnus, you dodge 'em.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Merle, you are not as lucky.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	A pretty sharp, like almost blade of crystal comes flying in your direction that's been sheared off of a- sheared off of a tree nearby, and hits you for [rolls dice]... seven damage, and knocks you to the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your- your spacesuit… um, is not cut open.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Whatever this suit is made out of is- is- is sort of protected against… uh, slashes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	But that's gonna leave a nasty bruise, isn't it?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All of these crystal shards are flying together and sort of floating in air and self-forming to create a pretty horrifying sight.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is a creature?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it stands at about 15 feet tall.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's got four razor-sharp claws extending off of these arms that are nearly the length of its body.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's got these long legs that end in- almost in points?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It doesn't appear to have traditional feet, it seems to be just sort of suspended in the air somehow… it seems to be just sort of suspended in the air somehow.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And its torso is comprised of a large single piece of tourmaline that's about as broad and tall as a refrigerator with these nasty looking spurs poking out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Its head is these- more of these crystal blades coming together to form like a pyramid-like peak.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And that light has risen out of the pond you're standing on and is now spread throughout this entire… crystal golem, making it appear like his insides are all just white fire.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And uh, it's pretty- it looks pretty menacing.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I whisper to my shield,	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	While you did that, very discreetly, this giant razor-sharp crystal monster is just kind of eyeing the three of you over.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Standing still for the time being.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It turns its head.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It flies at you, Taako, and puts its head just like, inches away from your own.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And gets real real close.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It backs away from you, Taako.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It sort of moves backward.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus, it turns to you next, and it sort of flies up on you next and gets real real real real close, and just kind of eyes you over.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it's glowing, it's glowing a little bit brighter inside, that white light.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I eye it right back.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You don't move, you’re steely gazed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Do you wanna try and intimidate it?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeaaaaah!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Now that you mention it, I do!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, you crit, and it backs up, like, a millimeter.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So little that maybe your two cohorts didn't notice, but you know.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he backs away from you too, like he backed--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	--like he backs away from Taako.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then Merle, he moves to you next, and he gets all up in your business.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He gets all up in your grill.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I start to very subtly and very easily… cry.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[all snorting] Big tears are rolling down my cheeks.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Because I'm sure he's going to kill me.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And then with a quivering lip, I cast Meld Into Stone.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I can meld with him--	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That white light inside of him, Merle, is now glowing...even brighter.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And this big crystal golem moves away from the three of you now, and surveys all three of you one more time, and then holds out one of its long sharp claws, and points it at Merle.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear stones in its head rub together to form a sound that sounds vaguely like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I am going to two-handed slash him with Railsplitter.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay well, good news, I’m gonna attack again with my second attack.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And, uh, next in the order, you see him-- is the crystal golem.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You see him, start to like, he wants to attack you because of the attack you did to him, but he actually turns towards Merle.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	--he’s going to float over in your direction and uh, rake one of his claws at you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um yeah, he hits you real, real, real hard.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Alright, I am casting one of my new spells, Guardian of Faith.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And we can see it.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And what is it- can you say what this thing looks like?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, then I say it looks like Della Reese.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, but this thing can’t move, it’s sort of like a stationary…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It’s staying right next- it’s right next to us.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, so you’ve built a little security person for yourself.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna cast um… You know what, I’m gonna ca- I’m gonna try this, I’mma try uh, uh.. Shatter.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, uh, so, here- here’s the problem- um, this- this thing has gotta be close to at least Merle, cause it just moved and attacked Merle.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How big is the thing?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How big is the creature?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Oh, I did say it was 15 feet tall didn’t I?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, and so I aimed at its head-	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Four-foot-eleven and a half, tops.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ok, um, not only that, one of its arms just explodes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You just sort of reduce it to pink dust.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As, uh- so yeah- his arm explodes, um, but from behind the three of you, you hear more moving, uh, and, uh, more pieces of crystal tree uh, fly at this thing, and builds an even, uh, more deadly-looking razor sharp clawed arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Magnus is 400 years old!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Taako has a peanut allergy.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Merle likes long walks on the beach.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, okay, we’ll say you guys are--start moving away from this big crystal golem, and we’ll use Magnus’s turn as sort of the basis of that group action.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Um, and on the start of this crystal golem’s turn, he watches-- which--where are you running?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Um, remind me the options?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Back to where you dropped in, or that white circle of light around the metal hatch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	White circle of light, please.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, the three of you make a break for that white hatch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Wait a minute, can we please at least go [wooping, imitating Zoidberg from Futurama] “wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub”?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yes, I will assume that that is what you--the sound that you created as you did that.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And, uh, as you bolt, on this crystal golem’s turn, Della Reese is gonna get [a gasp, as if they forgot that Della Reese was here], uh, a strike with her heavenly sword [pronounces the w in “sword”] on it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So, yeah, Della Reese just stabs this thing right through its--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	For, uh, for, yeah, it gets stabbed right through the ol’ chest.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear it scream.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Through that--that--that crystal beak, um, that it intimidated Merle with earlier.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear it just, like, scream.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and the--the light in this thing, uh, kind of pops out of its chest and leaves that crystal golem, and the golem just falls to the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And a rift, uh, opens up back in--in--in space, and the light flies into it and disappears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Della Reese… Della Reese looks at you and says… “Looks like someone just got touched by an angel.” Then she- she sheathes her sword and disappears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I mean, there’s a bunch of, uh, you know, virulent crystal all--basically everywhere.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, yeah, it is a circular hatch with a gap in between these two semicircle doors, um, and there is a--a--there’s a--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, so you-- this hatch has a small panel on the door of it, and it is not crystallized, and you hear, actually, Lucas come in through the pendant that the Director gave you before you, uh, departed from the Bureau of Balance headquarters.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear Lucas say:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I do that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Are you saying that into the pendant?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, I’ve got my hand over the pendant.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Talking to Merle and what’s-his-face.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	All right, I uncover the pendant.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I put my hand on the thing.	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh okay, I don't want bad burns.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And you nee- you need those hands.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Now Griffin, are we safe to assume that everything has been crystallized just to save you a little time in describing everything?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So yes, if you want me I can stop saying that word.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	As much as I have been.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I'm just afraid it will begin to lose meaning.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Could you start describing things by what hasn't been crystallized yet?	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Like if there was air in a room, you wouldn't say like, "And there's air everywhere, and it's just like, all around you, and it's above you and below you in parts."	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You just want to stop the world and melt with him!	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	If I meld with him, maybe I'll know what he's thinking!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	[crosstalk] All right, I won't meld into stone.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Uh, did he finish the statement by saying [low, gravelly] "suck"?	Clint

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah no kidding.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s a neat spell.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Sometimes Magnus rushes out.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It would be the first time I’ve heard of it.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, you don’t know.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	Well, we don’t know about that.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	We haven’t even gotten to that yet.	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Guys- fellas?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Anything?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	 [laughs] You’re on your own.	Clint

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Griffin, wait, wait, wait.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Before we do this, is this not what we’re supposed to do?	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, I’d like to go check that out too.	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That is patently untrue.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s not in character.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I’m just telling you that’s-- I’m calling horseshit on that on behalf of our listening audience.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	--is not.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay, fair.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And I think we learned a little bit about Lucas today.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I gotta say, the timing on this episode’s a little bit off, ‘cause I think we’re at the end of it now, and, man, it would’ve been cool if it had ended with Della Reese stabbing a crystal monster to death and not the three of you entering a museum and then, like, having a talk with some guy about his grandpa.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, why don’t you re-cut that in here, Griffin?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	“I just love killing.”	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And hates elevators.	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	This one’s going down!	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	How's the tinkle, Griffin?	Travis

MECHANICS		NO	Dexterity.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Athletics for balance, I guess, right?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I'll let you guys do either athletics or dexterity.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Athletics... [dice rolling].	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That is a... an 18, plus seven, 25.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That succeeds.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Lookin' for two successes.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	All right, that's a 19... [Griffin: That'll do it.]	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	plus four, that's 23.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	[Stuttering for intense jock radio effect] S-s-s-s-seven!	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Ten experience points!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Ten- 11 for me, thank you.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	[laughing] Wait, you fucked up!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	'Cause he needs it more.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	And you all three are gonna need to make some- some athletics checks.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's a ton of damage, but…	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Thirteen plus seven, 20.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Again with the athletics?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Uhhh, nine… plus… four, 13.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	A quick- maybe acrobatics.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, no it wouldn't really be acrobatics unless you're doing like, some fuckin' Cirque du Soleil shit like suspending yourself by like, a single ankle-	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Ffffffffffiiiive.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Fiiive.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Five.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I want it stated that I rolled a 13, I mean, he got five, I shouldn't have needed that much help, should I?	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	Could I suggest a perception check?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	I suggest a perception check.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Twwwwwenty!	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled an 18.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled an 18?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled a three...	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	No I had to add...three for perception check, so it's a six.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	And I actually need all of you guys to make a dexterity saving throw to dodge all of these crystal shards as they fly in your direction.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Eighteen plus two, 20.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Sixteen.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Ten...plus... zero.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Ten.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	But- it doesn’t do- uh, well weirdly enough, it doesn’t do, like, slashing damage to you.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Um, it almost feels like the suit converted it to, like, blunt damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, a 7 HP-sized bruise.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Go ahead and make a bluff check.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That is... a... not good enough.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, that's one strike.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That's a nat 20!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	And then we're gonna roll initiative.	Crystal Golem
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled an 18.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Alright, that was an 8 but I get to roll again and add 2 to the highest one.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Oh yeah, my final number is 20.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	12 plus 2, 14.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	8.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, first in the order is Magnus.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Lemme get all my accoutrement here… ’kay, that is 14 plus 7, 21?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, that does it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And that is one D10 plus 6.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That is a 7 plus 6, 13, and I am going to use one of my new skills called Goading Strike.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	When an attack lands, it is the damage plus my thing so 13 plus 4, 17.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	So Ditto, you gotta roll a 17 or better and- on a wisdom saving throw, and on a fail the target has disadvantage on attacks not against me.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uh.. 15.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Not gonna do it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Okay, and how much damage did you deal?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I did 13.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, you actually did 6.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Two-handed strike.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That’s a 16 plus 7, 23.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That does it.	Griffin (distant)
MECHANICS		NO	That does it!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That hit it.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	That’s a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And that does… 3 plus...no, yeah, 3 plus 6, so 9 damage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, that’s 4 damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Remember, he has disadvantage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That’s a natural 20.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] Uh, that is a 15 plus 7, that’s 22, versus your AC.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, that’s definitely a hit.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] Uh, he hits you for 19 damage, and again your suit sort of catches those blades, and uh, sort of converts it into blunt damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Um, next in the order-- who rolled the 14?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, I did.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	It’s you.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	“A large spectral guardian appears, and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space of my choice”--which will be right next to me.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	“It occupies that space and is indistinct, except it holds a gleaming sword and shield--”	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	“--emblazoned with the Pipes of Pan.”	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Now, “any creature that’s hostile that moves within 10 feet of the Guardian,” which is standing right next to us, “for the first time on a turn, has to make a dexterity saving throw; it takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.”	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	And how long’s it last?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Until it deals 60 damage total.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, okay, but that’s your turn, right, cause you cast a spell.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That’s my turn.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, so next in the order’s Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	So, like, what’s this guy vulnerable to?	Justin
MECHANICS		YES	Do we know?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I’m gonna confirm immunity to biting damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Do you have any sonic spells?	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	Do you have anything that lets you meld with stone?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, “a sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of my choice, within range.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Each creature in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point-” I’m just aiming for like its head, um, “-the creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.”	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	“Any creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.” Yeah, that’s why I cast it.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Um, so Merle, you’re gonna have to be a part of this save as well.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It’s a ten foot radius-	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, so this thing has to save against your spell- spell saving throw.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Which is eight plus your spellcasting modifier, which is either six or seven- you don’t know-	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Seven.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Seven.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	So I have to beat a… fifteen?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yep.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, I got a seventeen, but I have fuckin’ disadvantage- [die rolling] fourteen.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, shit, ok, this thing’s about to take a ton of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice rolling] Five.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Eight.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Eight.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Twenty-one!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Twenty-one points of damage (pronounced damioge).	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	And it is your turn, Magnus.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And this thing… makes a dexterity saving throw.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[Dice rolling] That’s a nine, so I doubt that’s gonna clear it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	20 radiant damage.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Um, and it actually takes 40 radiant damage.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now, we’ve had to… um… get kind of creative with your approach?	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, we- we can’t have you connected in any way because… if say, for instance if you rappel down if the rope touches the crystal it could travel up here-	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mmhmm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-and we could lose the base.	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, so we’ve cast a- a levitation charm on both of these gondolas, and we’re kinda gonna need to… just sorta… hurl you down there.	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Hurl?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We're just gonna- Yeah, we're gonna like, um, well I'm not going to do it, Avi's going to do it, but we're just gonna kinda push ya off?	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Travis: Mmhmm] And angle ya?	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then just kinda do like a... like we're throwin' a lawn dart.	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I would be lying if I said this was the safest thing…	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm on board with it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-like we've ever co-- Okay, yeah.	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Has OSHA cleared this?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Absolutely not.	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mmm…	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But we've only got- we've only got about 36 minutes	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			left so-	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			OSHA, more like OHSHIT, let's do this!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay, and with that, Avi, if you'd do the honors.	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys ready to go?	Avi
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Feel the rhythm, Feel the rhyme!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Get on up, it's fantasy-- bobsled time!	Avi
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't know why I added	Avi
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			fantasy to that.	Avi
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, bye!	Avi
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			To the extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeme!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I feel bad for the other guys...	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just named that boat...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so we hop in the hole?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[with caution] Wait, I say we move towards the back of the boat very carefully.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeaahh, I'm- I'm with Merle on this one then.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Crystal voice:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pulled from my home inside a cloud	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lost to the dark I drift alone	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now I've returned beyond the shroud	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ever to reign upon my throne	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here in my Crystal Kingdom.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What the fuuuck?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sound effect style] Wa-tewww.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Arrggg!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did I ever tell you about the time I fought all those crystal monsters?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, shield he’s lying!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hail and well met!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My name is Taako, and you look like you're made of salt.	Taako

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What's up now, Geodude?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low, gravelly] You.	Crystal Golem
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m into running.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, that’s fine by me.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If you guys wanna bolt, let’s do it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, yeah, looks like we are ski-daddling.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you okay with that?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know if you saw, I hit him and did, like, six damage.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That is not something I am used to.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, you good with running?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--I think that this- you’re a bunch of honeys!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think this is the first time we’ve faced anything that was actually tough--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--that we weren’t assured of beating--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--and you’re gonna run away.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know that if we--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wah, wah, wah!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Run away!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You known that if we all die, there’s no more podcast and we don’t get the money from the MaxFun donations anymore, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Run!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Griffin laughs] Run away!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Run away!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			First of all, what the hell was that?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What just happened?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I heard a bunch of, like, crumbling and cracking and tink--crinkle- tinkles.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, it was us.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We, uh, there was a crystal monster, and we lured him into a trap that we had set.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We pretended we were running away.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pretended we were running away.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he fell for it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He fell for it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Dingus.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then we killed it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, we trapped-- sort of, yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We killed it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, we did.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, we did.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			20 experience points.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We gave ourselves 25 crystal experience points.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Griffin laughing]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, that shouldn’t--there shouldn’t be anything here.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anything that was in the crystallized rooms should’ve just gotten-- just should’ve gotten frozen.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t underst--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, you weren’t here, were you?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You weren’t here.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Lucas.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus here.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In your experiments with these crystals, did you ever hear a voice or sounds like something was talking to you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ummm, no.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t-- I don’t know what you’re talking about.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All right.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t believe you, but--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It didn’t happen to us, either.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noooo.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-uh.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Have you made it to the-- to the exit of the conservatory, to the first arcane airlock?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it the glowing hatch?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s what it would look like.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, sure.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Then yes.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hell yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just put your hand on the panel, and I’ll channel enough energy into it and let you guys through, and then once you move through that chamber, I’ll be able to shut down that airlock and buy us a little bit more energy and a little bit more time.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, is this gonna affect how the reclaimers-- all their shit and being able to get in and stuff?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought we were the only reclaimers.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I forgot who they are and what they’re doing.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t care about them anyway.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The regulators, the ones who are, like, supposed to back us up and, like, arrest--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, they’re doing a great job so far, aren’t they?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Where are they?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They got blown away in the gnarly storm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh man, like The Martian.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Love that book.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, okay?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re done here.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think that we’ve already proven that we can’t keep really good track of them, just from, like, a narrative-- human being-- like, I don’t think we can keep tabs on ‘em.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’ve got-- really gotta fend for themselves, ‘cause we need the time.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know what?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t fault your logic.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s what I’m saying.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Either they die--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Either they die, or we forget them.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Either way, they’re not going to--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Probably both.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, probably both.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[muffled] Hey, guys, did you go through the door yet?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, thank god.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It was getting a little stuffy in-- wait, that doesn’t make sense.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, that’s not how that works.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[someone laughs] Are you in the pendant?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you live in the pendant?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He is independent.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, that’s a good joke.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, just put your hand on the panel on the door and it should open up for you, and-- and, um, you’ll-- you’ll-- you’ll be protected, um, from the, uh, from that crystal thing.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should be-- the next chamber should be clear as far as I know.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I’m in character, so I don’t answer.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just was wondering if it might be a trap, but--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re obviously in a hurry to get through the airlock.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope, not a trap.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Eat me, we don’t know you!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re a real– you’re a dingbat, too.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t like you at all, but let’s go.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I say we get through.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is getting boring, and this is a podcast.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s go.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now you should be at a--a--a branch in the path, um, and-- and I’ll be able to buy us a little bit more time.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re at about-- oh, we’re running real low, guys.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re at about ten minutes before this thing h-hits the water, um, so whichever one you go in, I’ll be able to disable the airlock on the other side and-and buy us a bit more time by giving me more energy to channel, uh, into the core.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, so--so pick a side, and I’ll just, uh, I’ll--after you go through, I’ll shut down the other one.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This one’s easy.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s elevators.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s go.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here we go!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you made it to The Magical World of Elevators, huh?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus, Merle, & Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s, uh--well, this lab has been in my family for a few generations.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--I inherited it from my--from my mom, um, but there was a codicil in the will that required that I keep this museum, uh, honoring my grandpa’s greatest technological accomplishment, intact.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He--he invented the elevator.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And honestly, like, most of the technological, uh, advancements in our world.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was all--that was all Grandpa Roman.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, um, yeah, I couldn’t change it, but go ahead and have a look around.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s--I think you might learn a little bit of something about elevators.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t we have, like, shit to do?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it hard feeling like you’re always in his shadow?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does it--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ooh, good question.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you feel like you’re in Roman’s shadow?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, a little bit, sometimes, like--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m trying to make my own mark on the world, and frankly, I feel like a lot of his inventions were kind of primitive, and people just aren’t as excited about inventions.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, when the first elevator came out, forget about it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you try and invent a new, better elevator, and people don’t wanna hear any of it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s an up and down business.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			People say that about, um, Thomas Edison a lot.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, he invented the lightbulb, but--right?--but, like, they didn’t have them back then, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if I had been around back then, that would have been easy for me, ‘cause they didn’t have lightbulbs.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They didn’t have anything.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, like, inventing stuff was way easier.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			These days, I’d have to invent, like, a double lightbulb or something to even get that kind of impact.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Holy--just--wait--pau--hold on for a second.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I gotta write that down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double light bulb.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can have that one, that’s fine.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Light bulb…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, don’t give it to him!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, money's no object to me.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I feel like we’ve really grown.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think we’ve all--let’s go home and think about what we’ve learned.	Magnus

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uhh, you find yourselves in the Magical World of Elevators, something of a museum dedicated to the elevator-based achievements of the Miller family.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I wanna contact Angus and see what he knows about the Philosopher’s Stone.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So yeah, just put in his, put in his Codec number, ring him up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Tune into— like, spin the propellers we just told him everything.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So you’re in the Magical World of Elevators and there are uh— the room has these two rows, uh, that you can tell just looking at the elevators featured in each exhibit are sort of a chronological detail of how this particular invention that the Miller family brought to this world, um, sort of evolves.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s a little plaque and a little description next to each one.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The first one is kind of just a crude bucket with a thick rope that has a year, it says “1469 DR. Roman Miller.” Which you intuit to be Lucas Miller’s grandpa that you talked about last week.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This does not look like the safest elevator in the world, it basically does just look like a bucket.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It looks hundreds of years old, some cockroaches actually scurry away from that particular exhibit as you come close to it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and go near your feet.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And we stamp on them!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	We stomp on them, okay.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah Taako and Magnus you guys squoosh yours good.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Merle, yours scurries away.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So there’s a few more of Roman’s designs.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s a one that looks like a bucket but the pulley looks like it’s gas-powered.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, which looks pretty deadly.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	“Upsy, Your Lifting Friend.”	There’s one that has a face on it and the plaque says that it’s called
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s almost like a cartoonish elevator that was obviously made to like franchise.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like obviously when elevators came to this world it was a hot thing, cause you can imagine when elevators came to Earth it was probably really sick, like what, no more stairs?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, so they tried obviously to do a theme park.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[laughs] And then on the other side of the room there’s a row of elevators that were actually designed by Lucas’s mother, whose name is Maureen.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they’re way better.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re so much better.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	They’re more conservative, I mean they were developed, you know, a generation after Roman’s lifting machines, is what he called them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, so they look like the more traditional elevators, a little bit less stylish, more functional.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Somewhere down along the line of hers is “Upsy the Rad Lifting Dude” which is like a cool reboot of “Upsy Your Lifting Friend”.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He has sunglasses on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That elevator was a commercial failure.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Based on every sense of the word.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Like maybe they mastered like getting people up first and like didn’t have a plan for getting you back down?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s funny you mention that, actually, right next to “Upsy the Rad Lifting Dude” was his archnemesis in the cartoon and his name was “Downzo.”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then at the end of the line is just an elevator.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, but on the far side of this room, kind of in front of the next airlock leading out of this chamber, you see something that looks unlike all of the other elevators in this room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Stairs.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	It, it looks like— it’s stairs, isn’t that crazy?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like way too futuristic, it has like almost Tron neon outlines, uh, it looks like an elevator, but it is the most futuristic-looking elevator you’ve ever seen.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s sitting on top of a cylindrical glass display case, and when you look into that glass display case, it almost looks like there’s a miniature model of the town of Neverwinter inside of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And atop it is this hyper neo-futuristic elevator that is labelled as “The Elevator of Tomorrow.”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	To scale?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is it to scale with the rest of the town?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s like your size and it’s on top of the glass display case.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas chimes in through the pendant and says, uh:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Who’s going into the elevator then?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How many does it need?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How many does it take?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	At least one.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One to three, one to three players.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Alright, I’m getting in it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’ll get in it too.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus and Merle get in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Taako, you gonna stay out of this?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I open my pocket spa and fucking chill.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You crack open the pocket spa and-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	That’s right, I get in the pocket spa.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You pop open the pocket spa and get a little pop tent out that folds up neatly, neatly into your pocket and it’s bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you hop inside and you get in a hot spring and there’s little pucks of scent that you can choose to pop into that hot spring, give yourself a scented bath.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And also there’s a sandwich waiting for you on the lip of the hot spring.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What kind of sandwich?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Tuna fish.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But it’s a good tuna fish.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Anyth— any toppings?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, there’s some diced tomato on top of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, Merle and Magnus, you hop into The Elevator of Tomorrow.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s just a single button there and it has a timer over it that is stuck at three minutes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I push it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	As you push it, the doors of this futuristic elevator shut in front of you and, uh— Taako are you watching them?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Or are you like lamping?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	You’re watching them through the open—?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Through the open door?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	You’re watching them through the open door?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You’re watching them through the open door, okay,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a pretty, uh, incredible sight, as the elevator of tomorrow doesn’t go down— I mean it does, but it doesn’t go down in space, it actually goes down in scale.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The elevator of tomorrow shrinks, way way way down, and uh, Merle and Magnus you don’t really feel anything too different, but Taako you watch as their now completely shrunk down elevator— very slowly descends into the glass display case.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Cut to inside the elevator [hums to the melody of The Girl from Ipanema]	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Taako jumps out of the pocket tent and says	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He’s running around with his hands in the air like Jordan after he’s won one of his many basketball championships.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Back, back inside the elevator: [continues to hum the same song, is joined by Clint]	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The elevator, uh, comes to a stop and the doors open and all of a sudden this glass display version of the city of Neverwinter now looks pretty big to you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s not actual size, you guys are actually almost the size of some of the taller buildings in town, kind of a Godzilla thing going on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, but, uh, yeah it is a weird version of Neverwinter because it doesn’t look like the Neverwinter that you three have almost certainly visited at some point in your life.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s some things about it that are a bit off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The buildings are much taller for one thing, they reach into the sky.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s a, uh, there’s a—  there’s streetlights, they’re not like the gas torches that you might see in some of the more civilized towns in your world.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re actual electric streetlights.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there are metal battlewagons, lots and lots and lots of them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s a mobile in the sky, that uh, is carrying these different airships of different shapes and sizes and models that are circling this model version of Neverwinter.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it looks like an impossibly futuristic version of Neverwinter that you are now inside and as the doors open up, that three minute timer begins to count down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Outside the glass you guys can see Taako pretending to be Godzilla like stomping around.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like with little claws.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Taako, Taako as you look down as they step out of this elevator all tiny like, you probably do feel a sense of, uh, grandiosity, looming over them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, he’s gigantic.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, Taako, and actually, from your vantage point, you actually see something else on the outskirts of the town.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The elevator is sort of positioned in the center, the Times Square of this, uh, of this, uh, display.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Actually you see a cockroach, that is now scurrying over buildings and moving very, very quickly towards the two of them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	—this cockroach is over the two of you, on the side of a, on the side of a nearby building.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, and you hear it hiss and rear up revealing two dripping, green fangs.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uhh and it hisses at you nastily and then you hear like that sound effect that means you just ran into a random encounter in a Final Fantasy game.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And we’re off to the races.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	I, uh, I— the moment that I see that happening, I turn on my heels and sprint back into the pocket tent because I forgot my sandwich in there, and then I rush back to where I can see really good.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This thing is, uh, it’s actually not too high up because, again, you’re about the size of the buildings.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay yeah, the picture of a cockroach appears in your shield—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	—next to an armless robot and I think that’s the only thing you’ve …	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I’m gonna two-handed axe that shit.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	You’re attacking the cockroach?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna just attack, I’m not gonna do any of my special stuff.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And then I’m gonna hit again with my second attack…	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uhh, yeah, uh, you take one of its antennae off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can see it drop to the ground, it’s pretty gross.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It is— it is the cockroach’s turn and he’s gonna scurry on top of the building that he’s kinda on the side of and then point down at the two of you and then a cone of green slime is going to spray out of its mouth—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	—and comes towards the— comes towards the two of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, Magnus you, uhh, swiftly dodge to the side, stepping out of the way from this green slime which coats your short companion.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This is a, uh, Merle, it is a bad feeling when this slime gets on you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A bad burning, bubbling acid-y feeling.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	In my tummy?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It just— It just did.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It permeated it, it soaked through it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Your suit is wet with acid, and it sucks.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But it didn’t burn any holes in it or anything like that.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s a pretty great suit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Magical, one might even say.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m going to cast “Banishment” on the cockroach.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Okay, you just gonna yell “GET OUT OF HERE COCKROACH I DON’T LOVE YOU ANYMORE”?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah we’re gonna get back into ye old elevator.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, uh, the— you pop back into the elevator and the timer above that button says 1:30 on it and it’s counting down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[pause] We wait, patiently.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	sssssPOP!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The cockroach appears, it appears on the top of the building that it was on and it is— whose turn?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I am going to brace at the door of the elevator with my shield between the cockroach and us.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As this is happening you see Taako, uh, it looks like he’s trying really hard to open the glass that’s encasing the town.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What, is there another sandwich inside the glass?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah I’m going to push back if he tries to get into the elevator.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is it attached by the way, out of curiosity?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The glass encasing the whatever.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah it kinda like, kinda comes down in like a funnel, the pathway that it came through, uh, like a glass funnel, that they travelled through in this elevator.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[laughs] Okay, next is the cockroach who is going to scurry your way.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, so yeah, this thing tries to get past you, you kinda push him back with your shield.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then he’s gonna take a— he’s gonna jump in and bite at your ankle with his pincers, Taako, or, er, Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Well like from outside the thing?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He’s going to kinda like poke his head in through the elevator.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s about 12 seconds left on the elevator timer.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What part of the cockroach is inside the elevator?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, like half of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Managed to get in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus was like bracing the door with his body so only like enough to get in and get a good mouth around Angus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Or, uh, around Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So, I’m gonna hit him with Spiritual Weapon.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Alright, what’s it gonna look like this time?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s uh, it’s going to look like a great big golf shoe.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A gigantic, spiked, golf shoe.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Like a cleat?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Like a cleat?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But yeah the shoe comes down on this thing but it just kinda like gives it a kind of weird, like, shiatsu massage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then disappears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I start to pray.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	That’s fine, I’m gonna cast um, a cantrip, called “Minor Illusion.”	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Uh, so behind him I’m gonna cast like a… another one, like a picture of, um, another cockroach?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I dunno know, but it’s wearing a dress.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Whatever the cockroach is attracted to; it’s its greatest desire.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You create a sexual mirror of desire.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	That projects...	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s like dancing and it’s like singing that “Let’s All go to the Lobby” song.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, uh, yeah, you create a garbage sandwich, a dancing, singing garbage sandwich and the, uh, cockroach still attached to Magnus’s leg starts to scoot backwards but like doesn’t want to let go of Magnus’s leg.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, uh, he can’t pull you backwards out of the elevator to take you back to his desired sandwich prize.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear him sigh and he sounds kinda bummed out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	So does that mean… does he let go of him?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The clock has about 6 seconds left on it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I’m gonna free action put my shield away.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna go for the mandibles, ‘cause I got my fletcher’s mitt and my magic punching glove so I’m not worried about his poison or whatever.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna grab them and pull them apart.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	–uh, these, these two curved, uh, pronged, acidic mandibles come right off your leg and right off the cockroach, who you hear hiss again, and he kinda rears back, and is- is uh, uh, uh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But as it rears backwards, the doors, almost with perfect timing, shut, leaving this now sadly mandible-less cockroach back stuck in tiny town.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the elevator, Taako, you see it come up to the surface of the glass display case and return to its regular size.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the doors open, and as it does the lights inside of tiny town and the lights, those neon lights all over the elevator and even the lights in the museum shut off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And, uh, the three of you actually feel a jostle and your stomachs give out just a little bit as the lab very suddenly moves upward a little bit.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, so the only other thing really of note in this room is the exit into the next arcane airlock, um.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Really it’s providing the only source of illumination in this room now that all of the, uh, power has gone out in the, uh, The Magical World of Elevators.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Great, let’s do that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, uh, yeah it pops open and you hop inside and it’s very similar to the last arcane airlock you were in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is a brightly illuminated, white chamber full of white light and as you get in there’s another hissing sound as smoke comes out and—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And, uhh, yeah there’s another “Y” branch and there’s another sign hanging in between these two rooms right in front of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, one of the signs is labelled “Radiation Ventilation Maintenance Chamber”.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the other direction is labelled “Li’l Genius Buddy-Bot R’n’D”.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It opens and it reveals a much smaller room than the one you were just in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uhh, it’s a circular room with a vaulted ceiling, and um, about fifteen feet high and it’s pretty dark in here actually.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There is only a single light straight overhead that is shining down on a pedestal in the centre of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the, uh, on that pedestal you see— almost kind of built into the pedestal, you see a... ADORABLE little robot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This little robot is, uh, he’s got like an LED display face, that right now is just showing two closed eyes and one thin closed mouth.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Seems to be in idle mode.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s pretty cute-looking, except for one sort of problem, and that is this robot— and in fact pretty much the entire room— is pretty badly scorched.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s been blackened a little bit, uhh, but as you enter into the room and the airlock seals behind you, his eyes open up and plays a little powerup tune as he turns on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I call, I call— before anybody else does anything I call Angus.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas chimes in through the pendant and he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I whisper to them:	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, it starts to make a pretty horrific buzzing sound.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear a, some almost like old dial-up beeps and boops coming out of him, and then you hear a pretty uh, much deeper and less friendly voice come out of him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I reach down and turn my belt to fire.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You very quickly turn your elemental belt to fire.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you feel a wave of warmth wash over you, and then all three of you feel a wave of warmth wash over you as small holes open up in the room all around you, and jets of flame blast out of each one, uh, for about one second.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You are wreathed in flame.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ok Taako, you [makes a *whish* noise] you duck down real quick, you hide behind the pedestal and get out of the way of these jets.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	At the last second, I lift up my sandwich to get a nice little toast goin’.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I attack him with my hammer.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, and he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then the holes in the wall light up again.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Another spout of flame shoots out at all three of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[Clint gasp-sighs] As you are wreathed in flames.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I pick up my stone of farspeech.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The robot says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The room starts to glow blue a little bit, and then you hear Angus go:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then the line goes dead.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Um, while covering the pendant that lets me talk to what’s-his-face, whatsahoochie, um—	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[Clint makes a fluttery transition noise] I just told Angus everything.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, uh, make a reflex check to see if you can— there’s three cockroaches.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are we?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	To intuit from the name “Upsy” and the nomenclature of lifting machines.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, it’s uh, it looks very, very, very futuristic.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, no, it’s gigantic.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I pick Taako up and I walk him to the elevator.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s a little statue of George M. Cohan.	Clint

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay so you’re trying to banish it to another plane of existence… [Dice roll] Uh, I rolled a 13.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	“sssssPOP!” and disappears, uh, being spirited away to a harmless plane of existence.	I think it’s your spell casting modifier which is still more than 13, so, okay, yep this— this thing, after coating you in acid, just goes
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And now we just need to stand here for a minute while Merle concentrates.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, Magnus it’s your turn, you’re in the elevator and this cockroach just appeared back on top of the elevator it was on, or, er, the top of the building it was on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, no, he’s not, but it looks— he's making a very convincing show of it.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Uh, what?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, uh, and that is 9 points of damage as this thing bites, bites around your ankle and latches on with its pincers.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I’m gonna cast “Prayer of Healing” on me and Magnus.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah but with spikes, y’know like in golfing.	Clint

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So I’m not, it is— I’m holding onto that thing with the grip of life.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So let’s do another strength check as this cockroach tries to pull you backwards out of the elevator.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, he’s still holding onto him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	I’m gonna grab um, let’s see, would it be better to pull off his legs or his mandibles?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Actually the two of you make another dexterity saving throw ‘cause there’s just gonna be a little bit of gunk coming out of this guy now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you both, [Dice roll], both you guys take 4 acid damage as this thing’s produces, uh, an upsetting amount of goop, uh, as it rears backwards.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Can we take a rest?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Yeah, can I cast one of my healing spells?	Clint

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			H— Hello?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did, what did you guys need?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Ango, um—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			 [amused] Is that, is that happening?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, [Justin snorts], D’Jangus.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, what, what do you know about the Philosopher’s Stone?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We just ran into like a crystal golem thing that like sang to us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it was like—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that shouldn’t, that definitely shouldn’t happen.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The Philosopher’s Stone is just a very powerful, um, sort of cypher for transmutation magic.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it allows you to change really any material into any other material, but it shouldn’t be able to animate material!	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because I mean, that, that’s just beyond its capabilities!	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you know anything about like a crystalline demon?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It was like a glowing ball of light, it sang, it was really creepy, it sounded like a vocoder.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How did it… How did it find you?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tell me everything.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, we were walking across a crystallized—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, uh.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it was somehow inspirited by uh, by a ghost or something like that, but it, you said it came through some sort of rift?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In spacetime?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep, he did.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s not… ghosts can’t really do that.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So I’m not a hundred percent sure what we’re up against here.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, but I’ll start cracking the books and see what I can find out for you.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, do that.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks, Ango.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let us know if you come up with anything.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no problem!	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I— I love you.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Love you too.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shut up, don’t— no, please, no.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m a big fan.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			One for each of us, baby!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come to daddy!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I hate cockroaches!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Merle, why do you love um, why do you love cockroaches so much?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, what’s up?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shut up!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bug lover.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought you hated them so bad.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shut up, you guys, I’m saving my good rolls.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so, um, I left that running in demo mode.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s “The Elevator of Tomorrow” and it’s, it’s consuming like a lot of power.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if you can cycle through the demo, uh, I’ll be able to shut it down remotely and that should actually free up a lot of energy for me to channel back into the lab’s core and keep us floatin’ above the sea for a little bit longer.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What does the demo do?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What is it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, it’s a… I don’t wanna spoil the surprise.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s a—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well here’s my surprise: I’m not doing it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, I’m done— Taako, that’s me, hi— I’m done with elevators.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Never again.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, well don’t say—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Last time I was in an elevator, vines tried to eat my dick!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m never getting in an elevator again, suck it!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s not— listen, don’t say something you’re gonna regret.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, not a million-bajillion, my dude.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The, the demo takes three minutes, you just go in there and you do the demo and it— it—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ll have to knock me out like B.A.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Baracus gettin’ on a plane!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I— No way!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here, have a drink of this water.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Absolutely not, nooOOO elevators for Taako!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, well, some of you, some of you guys need to get into the elevator and— and run through the demo!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Or else it’s not gonna cycle and I won’t be able to shut it down!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Go for it, thugs!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako’s here!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, I’ll— I’ll take care of it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ll do it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Terra firma, baby!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How many will it take?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, at least one needs to go in.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And how do you know what we’re doing?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you watchin’ us?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I just heard, I asked you in the last episode where you were and you told me.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mm-hmm.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wh— why can’t—?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why did—?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t even think I need to do this, this is not important!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C’mon buddy.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t do it!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I swear to God!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[laughing] He pities the fool who carries him into an elevator!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You will not like how this ends!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I will burn a spell slot on you, I give no shits!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do not put me in an elevator!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m done with them!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ooh, daddy like.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh delicious!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, great.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Stupid!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was my plan!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just want to keep it alive.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I’m just eating a Triscuit and chillin’.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I couldn’t give a shit.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you see?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you SEE?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t look so stupid now, do I?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You tiny bitches!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I could eat you!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, Lucas can you still hear us?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty cool, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, so, what’s the deal?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like can you tell us about it now?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, this is, this is my vision for Neverwinter and ideally any town.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And, um—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So not really an elevator though, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like we didn’t really go up or— Like it’s not like, this didn’t get us to a different floor so it’s a pretty shitty elevator, really.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s all semantics don’t you think?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it was more of like The Shrink Machine Into a Version of Neverwinter of Tomorrow.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well you did go down technically speaking—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean yeah, but it didn’t really elevate us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Okay, but imagine, what if we could build a tower that could get smaller as you go up, so you can shrink in size and adjust your own size as you go up wouldn’t that be neat?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Damn it, Merle!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m sorry!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sighs]	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Man, it’d be super cool if we had like, our wizard with us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[high pitched, as though from a distance] Looking good!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can get ‘em!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was there anything else we needed to do in here besides get attacked by one of your janky-ass cockroaches because you don’t clean your elevator room?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah that’s how it works, it’s my cockroach just ‘cause it happened to appear—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s your lab!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Clean your shit!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah my shit is pretty clean, okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t spend a lot of time polishing the elevators.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My bad, I guess.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, no, there’s not much else to do in there except appreciate my bold vision of the future, but I guess pearls before swine and all that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, it’s super great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I love your shitty elevator and your weird glass town.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did you see the airships?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah that was great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re a real dork.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought it was a nice touch.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, it was great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I love the way that they were there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, they were there.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And, um, actually there was a way, if you climb up one of the buildings, you could’ve ridden—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, we have— Taako’s doing his best, we just have to make it to get back there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We have to protect Taako!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wow, great work guys!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We just added a whole lot of time to the clock.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was able to give us an extra like 24 minutes, uh, that thing was using a lot of power.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m gonna watch an episode of Parks and Rec!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, you got the time for it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What did you think of my city?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It was super great!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s share the mandibles.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s two of us—	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re my fucking mandibles.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No they’re not!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey wait, how do we split two mandibles three ways?	Taako

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s how it works.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, well, that’s, that’s Hodge Podge the Buddy-Bot, he’s there, he’s one of my inventions that I’m most proudest of.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, because he’s gonna teach the youth of tomorrow to be, you know, sharp, like me!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, we can’t have a better tomorrow if the children of tomorrow aren’t educated to be whip-smart adults.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So I made Hodge Podge to sort of pass some of my intellect on to the future generations!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s a real sweetheart.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool, what’s he do?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He just, y’know, quizzes you on stuff!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you learn, and you learn and you become smarter by being quizzed on stuff.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You get smarter?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uhhh okay, sounds pretty straight forward and uuuhgh whataboutthefire?	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, that’s right!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We had, the room was in R&D mode, we were doin’ some stress testing on him just to make sure, you know, before we release him as a commercial product that he can stand up to, y’know, enormous amounts of pressure, or—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For when kids set him on fire.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, yeah, if a kid put him in an oven we didn’t want him to, like, break immediately.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s gonna be a pretty expensive toy, so the room has some stress testing capabilities, but just, like, don’t go poking around into the walls and you’ll be fine.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, if you can actually run through his program, you’ll be able to shut him down and I’ll be able to remotely turn that room off.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, get to work!	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Can I make, uh, Griffin, can I make an Investigation check on Hodgepodge to see if I can see any visible sort of, like, switches or any-anything that might give me a hint as to how to stop him?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, yeah, right on his tummy is uh, is a switch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, he’s got a, he’s got a switch and it’s right on his tummy.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it looks like a- and it looks like a light switch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Uh, I flip it.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, yeah, you reach over to flip this, uh, light switch off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And just as you’re about to make contact with it, it sort of zips inside his body, and a metal panel closes over where the switch was.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I did it dexterously so he didn’t notice.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Hodgepodge says.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I open my mouth, and what do I say?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You say-- You say, “Doug Math!”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I am going to take a step behind Merle.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[Crosstalk] And pat him on the back, “Yeah, yeah, you got this!”	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, his body is like, part of this… pedestal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	His torso’s sticking out of it like, Zoltan style.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Alright, I attack him.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the flame jets kick on again.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you duck out of the way of the flames.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You duck out of the way as well.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you duck out of the way as well.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All three of you duck out of the way of these flames.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, and he goes:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna cast a spell, it’s called ‘Commune’.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And he’s just kind of sitting there, just dormant, and you hear the servos inside of him that’ve been, like, kind of audible this whole time just- they’re spinnin’ up real fast.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And a little bit of smoke is now pouring out of, uh, of his body.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The flame jets around you, their pilot lights come on and you see them start to kick into danger mode?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But before they can do anything, Hodgepodge just explodes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That blue light that has been surrounding the room this whole time is now gone, and you just hear everybody just yelling at you, all at once.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You - you hear the Director saying like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear Lucas asking how you guys are doing too.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear Ango and he’s cryin’.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear Ango cryin’ and he’s like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The hatch to the airlock opposite the one that you entered this room from is now illuminated with white light.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I pull one of Hodgepodge’s arms off.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Other than the airlock, this room’s gone pretty dark, and you hear Lucas say,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The line is dead.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	We move through the portal!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Or whatever.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yup, there’s another airlock.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This one only has one exit out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	We take the left one.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[laughs] Okay, you take the left one of one.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you find yourself in a slightly larger circular room than the Hodgepodge R&D chamber.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There are a few points of interest in this room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s a big pillar in the middle of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There is some hanging ventilation system overhead, and there’s a grate that has been busted out of the bottom of one of these - this vent system.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the grate is now laying on the floor, so somebody clearly busted that out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s a note on the pillar, that looks like it was pretty quickly scrawled out, that says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Sorry, that “K” is how they signed it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You’re heading toward the center of the compound, which is where the elevators are.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This room, by the way, is not crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It has not been crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And a robot about the size and shape of a car engine floats out from behind the pillar.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And instead of immediately setting you on fire, or asking you riddles-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That’s the size of this thing.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s a very huggable robot, [laughing] approximately twelve sandwiches-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	[crosstalk] How many sandwiches tall?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Twelve sandwiches worth.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I hug the robot!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It has a sign saying “Please Don’t Hug.”	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s covered in poisonous barbs.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I hastily hide the arm in my pocket.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This robot, its core actually does look like a floating car engine, which I have written down here, now knowing that you have no fuckin’ clue what I’m talking about.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s just a big, heavy block of metal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Imagine - if you’re - to give you a more robot-centric point of reference, more Conky-shaped than an Alan Tudyk-bot from “I, Robot.”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Does it have arms, legs?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It does!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And again, it looks like it was made out of parts from other robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So it has this big, hulkin’ central core with these vents and ports that don’t actually look like they’re in use.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as they take form, you can see clear as day into this scene:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see two men sitting on a pretty comfortable-looking sofa with a big pitbull splayed out on top of them, and they’re looking at this flashing, illuminated box on the other side of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then suddenly the image changes and you’re looking at sort of an older woman who’s sitting in the driver's seat of some sort of vehicle and she’s listening to the smoothest jazz in a line of other vehicles in front of a building with a sign with a big burger on top of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then you see another image.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He’s in a large, metal tubular room with these rows of mostly-full seats and there’s a loud whirring noise in this room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a bundled-up woman hiking up a steep hill, and behind her, you see a brightly-lit city skyline that’s towering over this massive harbor full of boats, and the buildings in this skyline are taller than any you’ve ever seen before.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And, like, every ten seconds or so, your perspective looking into this mirror just shifts, and it’s showing you more and more scenes of this impossible world.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Alright, I throw-- I close the compact.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I put it in my bag.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear a voice come through your pendant:	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, and there’s, like, a little-- you can see like a faint sort of impression, and it’s right where the plaque is on, uh, Lucas’s side, that says, “Lucas’s sleeping quarters.” Where that looks like it would be over this door, it’s just gone.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And right as you say that, uh, you hear a sound that sounds like, “WOOM”, and uh, as you turn to investigate the source of this sound, you see a rift in space, uh, about 20 feet in front of you, close to the central pillar in the middle of this room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And from out of that rift, you see a little chunk of pink tourmaline, and that pink tourmaline is illuminated from inside with a white light.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and as soon as it pops through that rift, it falls to the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as soon as it touches the ground, the room begins to transform.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, it starts to spread out from where that crystal touched the ground, and climbs up the pillar and spreads all over the ceiling, uh, it’s spreading all over the walls, and it, uh, takes over the whole room, and then, almost as soon as the transformation is complete, you begin to hear them tinkle-crinkles again.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she is becoming very cognizant of where she is floating, making sure not to touch anything.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, you hear those tinkle-crinkles, and they’re building, and they’re building, and they seem to be playing another melody.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it sings another verse of its song.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, your, um, your stones of farspeech and, uh, the pendant that the director gave you, um, uh, are-are just not functioning anymore, um.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is not so much a question, as much as it is the set-up for a riddle joke.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There is no- there is no definite answer to this question.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What?	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes, not bullshit.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, sorry, kids!	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			By giving me a question that I cannot answer.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was your second question, Merle.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s not pronounced like that!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s just how I, okay--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How do I shut you off?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am powered by Lucas’ laboratory and its core power unit.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[someone snorts] Only by shutting down the core power unit will I cease to function.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This has not been a very exciting round of Stump Hodgepodge.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I ask another question?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes, Magnus, just because I am feeling a little bit bored.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What is a fact you don’t know?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There isn’t one.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I possess an almanac of complete world knowledge.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All knowledge that exists in the world, I possess.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who starred-- [Laughter] Who starred in the hit TV show “Melissa and Joey”?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Accessing deep database reserves.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[deep voice] Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Dammit!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, now it’s mine: What was the name of the guard on Today’s Special?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Y’know, the Canadian show?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Today’s Special.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What was the name of the guard on that show?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The security guard in the Canadian children’s television show “Today’s Special”... was…	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sam Crenshaw.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is terrible.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is just terrible.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I couldn’t remember.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Laughs.]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been trying, and it’s been bugging me.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thank--you are a useful robot.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There is nothing I don’t know.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I know--	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--all of the information that exists in the world.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay why did the guy leave Double Dare--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--and go and do that food--that Food Network show.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That Unwrapped show.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What did--was it his choice?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was it his choice?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do they still make Double Dare, just like, with a different host?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re still making Double Dare?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			According to his online diary, he did not prefer getting all slimy all the time.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Hodgepodge--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--we’re passing up a rare opportunity to answer every question we have in the universe.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am getting close to bringing this round of Stump Hodgepodge to an end.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I got--I got another question for you, Hodgepodge.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m just really enjoying our time together.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uhm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Could Pan make a rock so big even He couldn’t lift it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is a bad question.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This seems like, unfair.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And a little judgemental.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low voice] I’m so bored.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Me too!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s the largest prime number?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s up there.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, I’m mad now.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is stupid.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This game is not especially fair now that I think about it.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because, if you know a thing, it exists, in the world, and I will of course, also know it.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s my fish’s full name?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Stephen Q. Fletcher Esquire.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Damn, I think that’s right.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Of course it is.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How many fingers--how many fingers do I have behind my back?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is not information that exists in the world.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes it does!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m going to say: four.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Damn!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was right!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I want to make you a full-time character, Hodgepodge.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think a lot of people would really enjoy that.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, come with us then!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come join us.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Unfortunately I can’t.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am built into this pedestal.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I--	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here, let me pick you up.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cake or pie?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, god.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The answer to that is of course pie.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[quietly] Hell yeah it is.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			WRONG!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalking with Magnus] Yeah, pie.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For live-- for life.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, uh, uh, uh, how would you feel... about-- can I just cast a spell on you?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, I’m used to solving things with magic.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That would be-- that would definitely be cheating.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And cheating would have to be [deeper voice] punished.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hodgepodge, I have a serious, important question.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Go ahead!	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What was the source of the voice that we heard speaking through the crystal golem?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That voice was generated by some sort of computer program.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Next question.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[deep voice] Oh, you’re being very predictable.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wow, nice one.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sounded really sarcastic.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It was, a little bit.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m getting pretty bored.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been so bored for so long.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is there nothing I don’t know?	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[a smooth, calm voice with reverb] Hello, it’s me, Pan.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s up?	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is a new number, who dis?	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Dear… Pan-enly father.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It is I!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your humble servant, Merle Hightower.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just to make sure, your name is Merle Hightower Highchurch?	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but I just go by Merle.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway,	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sick.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I prostate myself in front of you-	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How can I help you, my child?	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I prostrate myself in front of you, begging your divine wisdom.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I think I can only hit you back with yes or no answers, but let ‘er rip.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Question number one.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is there a question we can ask this damn robot so that we can get on with this game?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There are many questions!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, sorry, just Yeees!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So far, so good!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Two other questions, my child.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, you didn’t actually answer it, I said is there one.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Then-- no, I didn’t know that I was a part of the riddle.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re a god!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I definitely am.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Question number two.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you think I’m stupid?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nah.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It was really kinda non-committal.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s yes or no only!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know how to-- No, you’re not stupid.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re beautiful.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[tearfully] I don’t care what happens now.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No third question, okay I got -- I got stuff to get back to.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Guys, what should I ask?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ask if we know the thing he doesn’t.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Of course.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he didn’t ask that.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not talking to you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh sorry.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is-- he has it on--	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Not my god, bro!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was a freebie!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s got it on speakerphone!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, do we know the thing he wants us to ask?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just told your friend, yes.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, god, I -- okay, the answer to the second question is now yes.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it about the movie Kazaam?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s not about the movie Kazaam.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That wasn’t me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That wasn’t me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was Magnus!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I told you it’s on speaker phone, homie.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, the three of you are sharp, sharp, sharp cookies, I know you can figure this one out.	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve gotta go--	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve got-- I’ve got a pie baking in the… oven-- what is it?	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I forgot the word-- later!	Pan
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shit!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have- I have a question for you.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, but I have to warn you, my patience is wearing pretty thin.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a question for you, are you ready?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who do we work for?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who… do we… work for?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I do not understand.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[static, faster] I do not understand.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[even faster, breaking up] Idonotunderstand.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[inaudibly fast] Idonotunderstand.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[frantic] Come in!	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come in!	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus, Merle, Taako, come in!	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come in, come in!	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is anyone there?	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, boys, are you--	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Go for Magnus.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, thank goodness you - you’re safe!	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[breath hitching] I thought I was helping you guys and I knew I shouldn’t have been doing it.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then when it went dead I thought you guys had died and I was just trying to help and I’m so sorry- I’m s-	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Ango.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Angus.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Angus!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Director, slap Angus for me.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, that doesn’t- I think that would show up on the HR rep-	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do it!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s a little boy and I’m like an adult woman-	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t think, smack!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A little - a light-	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Less talky, more hitty!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s smack o’clock!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			 Okay, a little one [light patting noise].	Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ow!	Angus, whimpering
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			God!	Angus, whimpering
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			!	Angus, whimpering
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pull yourself together, Ango.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Someone quick, get a picture!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Get that on the ‘gram!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now kick him!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now kick him, right in the butt.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Kick him!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Kick him real hard in the butt!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Push him- make some spaghetti and push him in his spaghetti.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, that’s a good one!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Call him some names!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re like a Patch Adams!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sniffling] I’m so glad-- I’m so glad that the three of you are alright… [more sniffling]	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you put an adult on the phone?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We appreciate it, Anus [sic].	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, let’s talk to an adult please.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, I had this idea.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What if you asked him something that the Voidfish had erased.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no, he’s dead.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s dead, it’s fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He blowed up.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He blowed up real good.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We got it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, thank goodness.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, b--I--I love you, bye!	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, I’m afraid we won’t be able to endorse your robot.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What happened?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What - I, I lost contact with you guys-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, yeah- [sighs] You’re supposed to say, like, “Me neither,” have you not seen Jurassic Park?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Me - me neither.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, bye!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, man, that was a big burst of energy!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When you destroyed Hodgepodge, you freed up all the energy he was using.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You bought yourself about, almost forty minutes.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think - I think we might just survive this thing!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[interrupting] Hey, um, Lucas, I’m sorry we killed your robot son.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s not really what he - he was, y’know, a product-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you need a minute?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you want us to say a few words?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Wasn’t he?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Do you need some time, or?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, wasn’t he your robot son?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No-w	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was he your robot wife?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			His love was real, but he was not?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sort of thing?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, tell us about it, Geppetto!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, he was just like a little - he was a commercial product.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, are you guys-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Suuuuuuure.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sure he was.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I ask a question?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you guys just mean to everybody?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We were not raised well.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[still imitating Lucas, robotic voice] We - are - mean - to - everyone-	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[also imitating Lucas] I built a robot son to love me!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Beep boop beep!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, that’s good, that’s fun, it’s not my problem.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was a sucky son.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your son suuucked.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sniggering]	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you making fun of my voice?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause I’ve got sinus problems that - there’s a reason for-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[extremely nasal mocking voice] “I’ve got sinus problems-”	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I’m gonna hang up now, uh, TTYL.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why don’t you invent a Neti Pot next?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Crashed into ventilation system.	Note
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Going on ahead.	Note
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Meet you at elevators.	Note
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-K	Note
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hello?	Voice
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hello…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[vaguely Southern accent] Are you in need of assistance?	Robot
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hail and well met, mechanical man!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m a… I’m a… well, I’m a robot, but I’m programmed as-	Robot
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A robit, huh?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Robot
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My name is Noelle…	Robot
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It doesn’t have an L in it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… Oh, god.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, boy.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s a real stinker, I gotta tell ya.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I help you three out?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you lost?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Or what - oh my god!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You are the first Noelle we have ever met.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You are - you’re hurt!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I help, can I fix you up?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please fix Merle.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[laughs] However you can.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Whatever you could do would be appreciated.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And be careful with your arms around Agnus-may.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What d’you mean?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t worry.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nothin’.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ll see.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ll see.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			High-five!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gim- gimme - hold on…	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now hold real still--	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, it’s not.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry, it’ll take me a little bit to synthesize more of this first-aid fluid-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We d-, I don’t need any more.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Screw these guys.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle, pleasure to meet you, um-	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s real nice to meet you too, hey, what are the three of y’all doin’ here?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re looking for Lucas.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas is in towards the center of the lab, but y’all can’t get over there, it’s been crystallized?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I’ve seen what happens if you touch the crystal, you get turned into crystal!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And so it’s pretty unsafe for y’all to be goin’ around.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’ve got these suits.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[simultaneously] We have these suits, yeah, the suits keep us that from happening to us.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So we’re fine on that front.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you guys have those - y’all have null suits.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, of course.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So I guess you’d be okay to go in and try and find him.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Have you seen some other people come through here looking for Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I must have missed ‘em.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, there are other folks here, too?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t worry about it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you show us the way to Lucas, please?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, well, yeah, sure!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Noelle?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we go on, uhhhhhhh, tell us what’s with them other doors.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, those are, I mean, that’s where-- that’s Lucas’ private quarters - you can read, right?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, yeah, cool cool cool, is he in there?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, that’s just where he sleeps and, y’know, keeps all his stuff.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What kind of stuff?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Fun stuff?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, I dunno, like his personal belongings?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like toys?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t go in there, usually.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, that’s-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you have access to it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, I could-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m asking for a friend.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess I could open it up.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, hey, excuse me, can you not do that?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Would you mind please not going into my room?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[imitating Lucas badly] I’m Lucas, and I say let him go in the room!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...I don’t think that was actually… I don’t think that was actually-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle what’s with the, um, shut down door there, the one- the other one.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, We- we don't really use that room anymore.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, it's- it's just vacant, but, we just don't use it anymore, it's sort of, you know.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Every lab has a derelict room in it, so.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is that like an old saying?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, it's like-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no, that's just kinda like common knowledge, if you have a lab, you gotta-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You gotta have a derelict room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			(Crosstalk) You gotta have a derelict room in it!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think my grandmother crocheted that on something.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Noelle, might I say, you have, uh, beautiful arms.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, thank you.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean it's more of-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Disguised as Lucas] Hey, what's going on here!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my- oh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How did you-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well- how did you get- how did you get out?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought you were trapped behind the-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nah, I have a null suit, where do you think they got it?	Taako

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--for later con-using, and then using those clues to solve later conflicts, it’s like you three’s core competency, you’re like the fuckin’, you’re like superheroes, for remembering and observing shit.	Ernest
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thank you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That means a lot to me, Bud.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My favorite part is when the Robot literally said “say the thing that you know that I don’t” and that wasn’t enough of a-of a hot, hot hint for you guys to solve the daily double.	Ernest
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m glad you enjoyed that.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, you know, sometimes it takes a second, but we got there, thank you.	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-- but the parts of my laboratory are covered in virulent crystal that if you touch it, you get turned into crystal and die.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What can you tell us about Noelle?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you guys found Noelle?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She’s just like, uh, she’s just like an assistant.	Lucas

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why does she look cobbled together from other parts?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, I don’t know what you’re talking about.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m sorry that my design apparently isn’t up to your… ‘standards.’	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, we just saw another robot buddy who was, like, real well put-together and she kinda looks like shit.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay yeah, they’re not cut from the same cloth, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, I--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did you build her when you were, like, eight?	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I-- She’s actually - she’s one of my more--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did you build her from a kit?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you forgot to look at the cover of the box?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She’s one of my more recent-- Okay, she looks a little rough on the outside, but you’re not really appreciating her genius.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was she supposed to end up looking like the U.S. Enterprise or something?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re just so obsessed with what she looks like, you didn’t even think about the fact that, yeah, the BuddyBot looked really cool, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mhmm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But he only had pre-programmed answers built into him.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle can think!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She’s, she’s-- Agh!	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, that’s a-- that’s good enough to uh, to wedge your axe in there, make a lil’-- make a lil’ hole.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like another sort of private sleeping chambers, much like the room, um, that you were in just before, in Lucas’s room, only it’s not lit up at all, um... it’s uh, it’s a bit... it does look derelict, but it is definitely a, um, a dormitory of some sort.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, great, let’s get out of here.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Did the nurse ‘bot see that?	Justin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, so you-- you’re making your way in towards the middle of the lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, so you make your way into that airlock leading into the centre of the lab, um, and as you sort of clear that airlock and get inside of it, the, uh, the central pillar in the middle of the room just kind of explodes, sending shards of crystal shrapnel, uh, all over the room, um, although they just kinda stop in mid-air, right in front of the airlock that you came through, um, and the curious thing about like, the shards as they’re stuck in mid-air, is they form almost a perfect, like, dwarf shape, um, as if they were all targeting, uh... Merle... when they-- when they flew in your direction.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, Angus actually chimes in through your Stone of Far Speech, and he’s like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and uh, Lucas says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, as you pop open the room labelled “hugbears”, you, uh, enter into a pretty curious scene, and it’s unlike any room you’ve been on in Lucas’s lab so far.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s actually a pretty cosy-looking living room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, and there’s a lit fireplace, and some-- uh, a mantle, with some family photos on it... but this room has been turned over, it almost looks like.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you say that, Taako, this-- this hugbear pile starts to sort of rustle around, [crosstalk] and you hear some groans coming from it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Yeah, I mean there’s no such thing as a hugbear, there is such thing as a bugbear, um, you’ve met one, um, Klaarg--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Um, uh, and the only thing you really know about bugbears is that they are giant, and super strong, and like, unswervingly violent.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	They are just little furry balls of-- of violence, and hate, and bloodshed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	They’re irredeemable kill monsters.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I’m watching like, “what are they doing?”	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m whispering to my shield about that time I fought a hugbear.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I’m walking up very slowly, and I find the adorable, sweet, open-minded...	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He devours you.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You’re devoured.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You heal-- you heal him from inside.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So you heal him for 18 points of damage, and this-- this bugbear with the cut on its head, who looks like-- sort of like the most grizzled of the bunch, uh, that wound starts to fade a lil’ bit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And uh, he wakes up, and the whole pile kinda wakes up, and uh, very quickly sort of gets to their feet, um... and the smallest of this bunch, uh, runs up to you, Merle, and grabs you, and screams, terrifyingly, in your face.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And uh, one of the bugbears, says, uh,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, Christy sets you down, Merle, and says, um,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And one of the other bugbears goes:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The older, grizzled one says, uh,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And another one-- another one speaks up and goes, uh,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All four of them look at you, Taako, immediately.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and Christy runs over to the airlock door, uh, and shouts,	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle says, um,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You guys say your goodbyes to the, uh, to the bugbears, to the hugbear family.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you leave the hugbear room, uh, you pass through an airlock that is just like a straight tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and this one, uh, this-- this single door is labelled, “Hugbear supply room”.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and uh, it’s where all the hugbears’ cleaning supplies, cooking supplies, all of the supplies they need to do their work around the lab, uh, are.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s some shelves, with supplies all over, it just looks like a big storeroom.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Even through your suits you can feel, uh, this room is actually really cold.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It looks pretty neat, actually.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s like a little crystal confetti cannon, coming into the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s pretty small?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s Merle from the future.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	The dwarf that came in with Carey and Killian.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	When you guys first crash-landed into the laboratory.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One of them is labelled “The Gravity Augmentation Chamber.” And… this actually looks like an older version of the airlocks that you’ve seen so far.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The door just kinda looks not as futuristic, I mean it’s still--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[Laughing] Yeah, basically, it is a… wooden airlock.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, so yes, uh, the-- the room has just been crystallized, this, uh, the central pillar is, uh, this white light has moved into it, and it has started to groan, and these large cracks are starting to form in it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, and it’s starting to make some pretty... gnarly, uh, noises?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, the door is-- it would just be a melee attack-- the door hasn’t been crystallized, um, because it’s-- it’s protected by the airlock seal, um, so yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and through that hole, um, you can see through the airlock, um, the --it’s, it’s open, actually, on the other side, and through that hole you can peek into what looks like, another sort of private residence.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh yeah, she said, uh:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You’re in this room, this central pillar is starting to crack.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Uh, where are you going-- what are you doing?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	At the airlock, like, the one place we’re supposed to keep going, right?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Like, my other option is back into Lucas’s room, take a nap, and hope that it doesn’t collapse?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and as they-- as they sort of fall harmlessly to the ground, uh, you see that light pass through another rift, uh, and disappear.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As that white light sort of disappears in through the rift, uh, you see Noelle has her little satellite dish that she has on top of her head that was pointing at her, and she says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You hear him flipping through some books and he’s like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So, you’re in this airlock that’s in one of these branching pathways, and it’s leading towards two doors, uh, and they are labelled as follows.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um... the one going to the left is labelled the “Death Laser Calibration Chamber”, and the door on the right is labelled, “Large Humanoid Species Behaviour Modification Testing”.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then that sign is actually scratched out, and underneath it, uh, in sort of crude handwriting, is the word “hugbears”.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And, uh, you can make out in this mass, four bugbears, uh, of various shapes and fur colorings, um, and they are all asleep.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But they are sleeping fairly soundly.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as you enter into it, you realize that this room has already been crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You realize it’s actually because there’s a small vent to the outside of the lab in this room, and there’s some snow blowing into the room, that’s actually instantly crystallizing and uh, falling to the ground, so there’s like a crunchy layer of crystallized snow--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And how cool would you say that looks?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Unfortunately, right underneath that window, you see a crystallized figure.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s wearing a null suit, only the helmet is open in that null suit, and you see a dwarven figure with a cigar in its mouth.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, no, you actually recognize this crystallized figure as Boyland.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	[crosstalk] His cigar- is the cigar covered with crystal?	Clint

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah sure.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Does he have anything worth stealing that we could take?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	It’s all covered in crystals, right?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Alright, so we move on.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is there anything that would be salvageable?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	That might be useful to us, or is it all just pretty common material?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is there any Wonder Glue?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is the axe that dad took any good?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, it’s not especially great.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Which, eh, which door are you checkin’?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and you’re actually -- once you get through, the whole airlock tunnel is just a giant, solid sheet of ice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and as you make it into the door, even that ice is sort of extending into the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Inside of that room, though, you see, um, two figures in null suits, battling what appear to be sort of, like, ice-covered robots?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And these two figures are just taking these ice robots to fuckin’ fool school.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uhm, uh, but yeah, in this winter wonderland scene, uh, you see Killian and you see Carey just merc’ing some robots in there.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it, you can’t really get a beat on what these three figures are?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And they seem friendly?	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Here are the two ways people say that someone’s not dead: [normally] “Oh, he’s not dead” [exaggerated] “He’s not deeaad!” You’re doing the second one.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You’re falling into that second category, hard.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You’re leaning into that category.	Travis

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just went with-- I just kept my original name.	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My bugbear name.	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is this like a Jellicle Cats kind of situation, where these are the names Lucas gave you, but you have your own names for each other?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like these are like oddly human-ous names.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] -Yeah sure-- we’ve got our original names-- we have our bugbear names-- but we choose not to, sorta, remember that part of our lives ‘cause it was pretty... we used to do some pretty bad stuff out there out in the wild.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you guys-- or perhaps did you guys-- depending, I’m not really sure-- know Klaarg?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait you-- you know Daniel?	Christy

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If that’s Klaarg, then... yeah..?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			S-- you’ll-- I’m sorry, how did you meet-- Klaarg was his original name, but when he lived here with us his name was Daniel, he’s my son, and... jeez.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re all-- we’re all family here, y’know, we were a family tribe of bugbear that Lucas found and sort of adopted--	Aaron

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well-- [crosstalk]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, was he Klaarg originally?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then he came here and switched to Daniel and went back to Klaarg, is that what’s up?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s hard to explain, you might-- you may wanna ask Lucas about it, it’s kinda-- the specifics-	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We totes will, he’s our buddy, I hugged him once, he gave us some Oolong, then he joined in a wacky racers thing with us, it was great--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is he safe?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is he alright?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] He’s totally fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s totally fine, he once saved my life.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s a good guy.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sounds like our Daniel.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he’s actually the ursine formerly known as Daniel.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, he’s fine!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We saved him from some bad dudes, [choruses of agreement] he saved us from some stuff.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gosh, we sure do appreciate that.	Jamie

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bugbears.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tell us about this other group you encountered before us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Aw, yeah, they were really rude!	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They came through, and we offered them, y’know, some tea, and we just... y’know, we asked how they were doin’ and they wanted to get by, and head inward-- towards the inner chambers in the lab.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we’re like, we can’t let that happen, of course, so we had sort of a disagreement--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, pardon?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, sorry?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We, um... totally gotcha, why- why can you not let-- hypothetically, a group of people pass by to get in?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, well that’s, like, sort of our thing, y’know-- we do our jobs around the place, but we’re also... we are still bugbears.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, so we’re like, really big, so we also do some light security work, um, for the lab as well.	John

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, what if Lucas said it was cool?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess that would be fine?	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He-- he didn’t tell us it was cool with this last group though, so uh--	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I…  [crosstalk]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was sort of a kerfuffle?	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was a lil’ dwarf guy that attacked us, so we gave him a lil’-- a lil’ piece of our minds, there was a lizard lady, and she threw some sort of smoke bomb at us-- and we all went to dreamy-dream town.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They sound like dicks.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[mumbled agreement from Merle]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I hated ‘em.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you hear me?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come in, Lucas--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, okay, I guess you’ve sorta found out about one of my less ethical sort of experiments.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sounds fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They seem great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Yeah, they’re really sweethearts.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, they really are-- they’re great-- they have these, um-- these inhibitors-- these inhibitor chips, in their brains, that I...	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was trying to come up with a way to like, have people that would do some help for me around the lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Ohhhh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But also protect the lab from attackers, so I…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Slavery, right?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, [sighs] I guess, kind of, yeah a little bit, but they-- I mean, they seem genuinely happy, and y’know, they didn’t like being... all violent--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] So this is why we couldn’t charm Klaarg again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I saw, I watched what you guys did with Klaarg-- when I watched you on the races, and when I saw him pop up, I was a little bit surprised-- I gotta know, what did you guys do to him down there?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slowly] We charmed him.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s our buddy.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You used, like a charm spell on him?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Klaarg, or as he was known here, Daniel Butler-- he was my butler-- he, um--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, you gotta get better at that.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C’mon.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A little subtlety.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Aw, no, I thought it was-- I thought it was cute.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, um, he ran off-- he got into a little scuffle with his sister, and he bumped his head, and I think it disabled the inhibitor chip, and he had a freak-out.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he-- he ran off and escaped, and all I can think is that when you charmed him, somehow the wires got crossed in his brain?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As it turns out, if you, like, inhibit all the aggression in a bugbear, they’re actually very sweet.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, and so I that think he’s a bit on the fritz, Taako.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, right!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, okay, now I remember-- I charmed him the first time we met him, to turn him into like, Kelsey Grammer?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mhm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think the odds are actually pretty good that he’s, maybe gonna be charmed by you forever, kind of like... on and off.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He can join a nation of podcast listeners, [laughter] in that particular affliction.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, so, Luco-- need you to pass on to these, uh... these hugbears, that it’s totally cool for us to continue on our way unmolested.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah sure, uh, hey guys, you just gotta let ‘em pass, okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re trying to get in-- into the middle.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we go, will you tell us just just a little bit more about the scuffle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was there a problem with the scuffle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, like, we were-- we don’t wanna be rude, we try to be real nice here, as-- as much as we can, but yeah these-- these three, um.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Honestly it was just the dwarf guy that was mostly sorta causin’ all the trouble, honestly reminds me of back in my day, um, one time a guy came into my cave and I just killed ‘em!	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’ve all been there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I definitely killed some guys who came into my cave, too.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just feel like if that happens, you throw ‘em right off a cliff?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it’s usually fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, I’ve thrown plenty of people off cliffs,	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s uh, cliff-throwing is what bugbears do best, really.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We should compare notes-- so we need to keep on movin’.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s all about the angle.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The angle --	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think it’s about the dangle, but that’s just me.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I guess I-- I guess we can let you through, if Lucas has vouched for ya.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So can ya tell me what’s goin’ on in this lab?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause I’ve heard lots of crinkle-tinkles--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, you guys need to get movin’.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, this is not a cool scene, you need to move on out.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, do you wanna come with us?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess we could, but like--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[in a deep voice] SWEAR FEALTY!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[in the same deep voice] Swear to me!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[normally] Sorry, I don’t know where that came from.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-you’re welcome to join us, but you just have to [deep voice] swear fealty!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I... is he okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] I’m fine.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should just do that, though.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, hold on, it might be kinda dangerous ‘cause it’s all crystallized out there.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s why I’m saying they should come with us, ‘cause they can’t go out that way, they have to keep moving inward.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but there could be other parts of it-- why don’t you-- I’ll tell you what, you four just lock yourselves in the airlock when we leave.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ll be safe in there, until we, we can come get ya.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, can we get y’all anything?	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we-- before you go?	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, can we get you a tea or somethin’?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I give you guys a quick shave, or--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I can cook you up a nice meal.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can make y’all a -a ham steak?	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Y’all have been lovely.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, we have got to mosey.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh… Farewell, we’ll never forget you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We will never forget our time--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess you don’t wanna know where the Bugbear Treasure is buried.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, where is the bugbear treasure?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Naw, just kiddin’.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m just playin’.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey wait, I have a question real quick.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why is there a second dormitory out there, do you guys know?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If you’re like, doing the day-to-day stuff.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was Lucas’s room, and then there was like an empty room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, well that was... well that was Maureen’s room.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Maureen...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Maureen.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Y’know.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas’s mom?	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gotcha.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah she’s, um.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She’s-- she’s not with us anymore unfortunately.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Where is she?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I should probably, uh--	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[whispering] I think she’s dead.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should probably ask Lucas about that, when, um.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know, like, later on.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys, um, should probably get a move on.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh huh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I get this feeling that the base is sinking, and we all don’t wanna die.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um... did Maureen die?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			God, how indelicate can you be, bud?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I didn’t know her--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he could’ve asked Lucas.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, I can talk to you guys about that later, let’s just-- can we get this show on the--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, Lucas can hear.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry dude!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We keep going.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Griffin trying not to laugh] Cool talk.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pretty cool day I’m having with you guys, my three friends.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C’mon Noelle!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh god, it’s Merle!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[chuckling] Twist.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The sad thing is he’ll never get to be Manland.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Meka leka hi...	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And at least half the time I knew him, he was covered in crystal.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we go through all the rigamarole and because my spell fingers are gettin’ a little rusty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I’m not touching you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, look.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not touching you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not touching you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[cont.]	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not touching you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, well, guys, it’s empty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s try the other one.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you sure?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I’m positive.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s empty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause I heard-- I saw your eyes twitchin’ a lot.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Empty as hell.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If he says it’s empty, it’s empty.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And when you heard me say, “Aw, shit, sweet flip!” That was just a, a childhood rhyme I use to help focus myself.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So you didn’t see anything?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s just a frozen room?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[picks up melody] Aw dip, sweet flip, my lit-tle nugg-et.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[singing] Are those ice robots?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, dunk…	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, there’s ice robots in there?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s part of the rhyme.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s just part of the song.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[to self] It’s oddly appropriate…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, but yeah, it’s em-pty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because I can, I think I can hear fighting?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like clanging.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You don’t hear shit.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s eight inches of ice between us and the ice robots.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			... There’s ice robots?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Son of a bitch.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, there are ice robots.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Fine.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Fuck.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do they have arms?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Not, well -- Currently.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The ice.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you melt it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I cast-- How ‘bout if I cast sacred flame, just to see if it’ll open if we thaw it out.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it, it’s empty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That ship has sailed, hasn’t it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, you’re not gonna be able to pull it off.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sighs] okay.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Kidding aside, I don’t, I, there’re people- I wasn’t kidding, it’s lying, they’re-They’re in there, Killian and, umh, Carey are in there.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And they’re handing a couple ice-robots their metal asses.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But they have it un-der con-trol.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			By no means do I think we need- they are in need of our, uh, specialized services.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gotcha.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So let’s check out the fizzy lifting room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cooool.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, what’s up?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s, uh, with your trash room?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, bless this mess, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, um, I, uh, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So I’m not especially great about, like, gettin’ rid of my, my junk.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because I might need it again some day.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And also I guess I don’t really know where you throw away industrial waste?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, um.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That, that chamber actually, um, Maureen, my mother, she actually worked on it, um, to sort of master, you know, gravity, anti-gravity technology.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s actually helped make our labs.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And your headquarters, so.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you made a weird, shrinking elevator-thing.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool, cool, cool.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty sick, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you remember when you went down there?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your mom made anti-gravity.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She had --	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shit’s pretty cool.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She had some stuff going.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was that before she died?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That she made…?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I would have to assume.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool and neat.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just get through there.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come on.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re gettin’ close.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[singing] It’s everything I dreamed it would be!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[singing] I feel aliiiiiiive!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For the first timmmmme!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you read my mind?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle, look at me!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re doin’ great.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m a angel!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re-- You’re a beautiful angel.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you’re floatin’ around.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you’re doin’ such a great job.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you proud of me?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m real proud of you.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, do a--	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How do I get down?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, hey, Magnus.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do a stunt!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I do a stunt.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[wonderingly] Oh, man.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, wow!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was real good, Magnus!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Am I the best at stunts?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re the best at flipping and spinning.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thank you!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re so great.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako -- Taako and Merle.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys do a, do a duo stunt.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[flatly] No.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought you’d have fun in the zero gravity room but that’s…	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This isn’t about fun.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can fly whenever I want so it’s like, pshaw.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I, I can, like, just standard not do magic, so this is, ike, the best I’ve ever felt, ever.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty good, I guess.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you wanna stay here?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[disappointed] No.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just signed a lease on a condo.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Lucas.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Me again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, what’s up.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s the--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys having fun in my trash room?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s the weird, bubblegum, octopus things?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Weird, bubblegum, oc-- what are you talking about?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, they’ve got, like, a snout.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Griffin described it better.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Were you listening?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Were you listening when he described it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I mean, there shouldn’t be anything in that, in that room.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s, like, three of them.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They were in broken cages.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re floating to me, in a very threatening manner…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh the tar--!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, they’re just tardigrades!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, they shou-- they’re just little guys.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty big!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re microscopic.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We were doin’ experiments on zero gravity, like, animals, how they thrive in it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no, tardigrades.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re microscopic.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Quit bein’ a-- quit bein’ so dramatic.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, these have thrived.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thrived is a good word.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They are thrived as hell.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, what?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like the size of, I don’t know.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How would you describe it, Griffin?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, a car engine.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That could be anything.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s not possible.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tardigrades are microscopic creatures.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Look!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, shit!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t see, but, uh, now I believe you.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, you guys need to get out of there!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tardigrades are -- we call them unkillable waterbears!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You gotta get the fuck out of there!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You call them that?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is everything a bear here?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Byyye!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The bad thing about tardigrades is that they basically will eat anything.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Some waterbears have been known to eat entire live organisms.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like rotifers.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And other tardigrades.	Taako

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Taako, er, Magnus, you push off of a box or something and manage to get out of the way of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I turn my special belt to Tardigrade.	Travis

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[pronounced “probiscus”] It's about 10 feet away from you and it's kind of like... eating its own, like, tongue, pulling you backwards into its—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So you manage to wriggle free of this thing's grasp.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You are still kind of slowly moving towards it, just because of, you know, inertia.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you burn him up real good, your little guardians... are they actually like, little, like, butterflies?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They're tiny Della Reeses.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re like- They're little tiny, no, who's the— Roma Downeys.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	These are little tiny Roma Downeys.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, a hundred little Roma Downeys speaking in a hundred	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	unintelligible accents all just pierce this thing all at once, and it looks really, really, really bad off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As this thing just kind of bites, bites onto your arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It didn't get through your suit, but you, I guess you're taking crushing damage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Did you say under my arms?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	It bit my pit?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, it bit your armpit, 'cuz it's a fuckin' nasty, nasty boy.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Taako, the one that has you all tongued up is going to quickly retract its tongue, bringing you right into its mouth zone.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He's gonna take a big bite of you too.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As this thing takes a big ol' bite outta you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then... Magnus, the one that missed its tongue attack on you looks kind of sad.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He's just gonna hock a big black tar-like loogie in your direction.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You are hit by this poison spit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[pause] It actually heals me!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Weird, it heals you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It was healing poison.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As this black goo sort of sinks into your suit and—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	—gives you bad feelings all over your skin.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But it also kind of recoils, because of that spit, and it is now sort of floating backwards into the big pile of debris that it climbed out of.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like I said, a refrigerator, a large pane of glass, three broken cages, some microscopes, two fire extinguishers, a set of weights, a giant industrial fan blade, wooden crates, and a red barrel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Um... [tuts] I am going to cast one of my famous, as they say, spells, if you're ready.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	It is unfathomable what I'm about to conjure, but it is a Phantasmal Killer.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I want to tap into its nightmares, and create- of the one that fuckin' attacked me, natch [short for naturally]- and I will create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This thing makes a noise, because like you said, they're unkillable, just like, emotionless monsters, this thing makes a noise that makes you think that the Satan that Satan's afraid of just appeared in front of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it actually unlatches its tongue from you and kind of like pushes you away from it, trying to like, get away from this, this double Satan.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How close are the fire extinguishers?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I grab it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I'm going to use it to propel me at, like, Wall-E style, at...	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I don't know, let's say the one that just bit Merle's armpit— no, that one took some damage already.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Um, the one who's sad about not getting to bite me.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	With my shield in front of me, so I'm basically like cannonballing into it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I wanna bash it with my shield in the face, real good.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This thing takes 11 points of damage, and you send it, like, flying backwards towards the big sort of thing of flotsam and jetsam that the other guy ran off to.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So yeah, they're all kind of towards the bottom of the room now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Do you have a throwing weapon or a bow or something?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm going to let the fire extinguisher keep shooting towards them [Griffin: Okay.]	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	—let go of it, and then I'm going to shoot the fire extinguisher with my bow and arrow— with my crossbow.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I use the fire extinguisher.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You send the fire extinguisher flying at all of them, and you shoot it with your crossbow, and it does burst and send white… white foam all over the three of them, and the bottom of the room, and that white foam… uh...  is going to blind them?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	All three of them are actually pretty clustered up right now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, so they're more than 15 feet away.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They're about 15 feet below you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But they're not in your sphere, no.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’ve moved out it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	My zone of Romas?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Not in my Roma zone?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	So they're all kind of clustered together, right?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yep.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Tell me again what's floating around?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Once again, there's a refrigerator, a large pane of glass, three broken cages, some microscopes, uh, one fire extinguisher, a set of weights, a giant industrial fan blade, wooden crates, and a red barrel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Griffin, does the refrigerator still have its door on it?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, sure.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, well I chastise Lucas heavily, never throw away refrigerators with a door on.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Do these vagina dentrata things, do they actually have eyes?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They, yes, but they're all – they’re covered in fire cream.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm gonna take that crummy ax with all of the names of what's his name—	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	This is like a Stephen King novel, you know, where a kid at the end does something… [Griffin laughing] I'm gonna throw that hand ax and I'm gonna throw it right down the ugly gaping toothy maw of that one that's all beat up from the Roma zone.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you throw the ax of children, the child's ax of wounding, um, but you don't throw it very hard; [cracking up] it's just very slowly... it takes like ten minutes—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	—as it just kind of floats towards this waterbear, and it hits it and just like— bink!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Doesn't it go in his mouth?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, it opens its mouth and it fuckin' eats it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's fine.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It digests it and shits it out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the shitty ax comes out and kills you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, that middle tardigrade tries to wipe the fire cream off his eyes, and fails to do that, and it looks really pitiful.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then its head just Scanners-style explodes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So the other one that did save, Merle, he's going to push off the floor of this room away from the big ball of debris and come at you, and as he flies at you, he's going to try and take another bite.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So instead he's just gonna try and Yoshi-tongue you to try and bring you in range.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You get out of the way of this thing's tongue.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It actually licks back and misses you with its tongue, and its tongue keeps going, and it actually sticks onto the big refrigerator.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear him go like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the one that is blinded is going to try and spit acid at Taako— with Disadvantage [crosstalk]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, you are hit by this poison spit as well.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	I am going to cast... are they still clumped, or what's the deal?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Not really, not anymore.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One of them is... they're probably about 10 feet away from each other.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One of them has a tongue attached to a big refrigerator, and the other one is sort of still back towards the big pile of debris.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Okay, um and how close are they to me?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They're both about 10 feet away from you also.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Then I am going to cast this as a, I'm gonna cast 3rd-level Thunderwave, and hit both of them.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, the one that was in the Roma zone, you blast him backwards with your wave of Thunderwave, doesn't there, isn't there a push effect, too?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, the Roma zone one gets blasted backwards, he just collides with the wall, and you see some pink fluid come out of his snoot, and he, it stops moving.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Dead.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He's dead, he died.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The other one that was back towards the pile looks pretty bad off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Also all of the debris in the back of the room has also broken up and now this room kind of has like a snowglobe thing going for it, where just like, there's just shit flying around all over this spot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	I'm going to... is there anything I can push off towards it?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, you're pretty close to the giant industrial fan blade.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I want to push off that toward the tardigrade.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I want to grab it and throw it at Merle.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So I bounce off and I grab it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So I throw him at Merle.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You chuck 'im real good.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You chuck 'im real, real good.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So for my second attack, I'm actually going to Command Merle to attack, uh, make a weapon attack, and then I add my Advantage, uh my dice to his damage.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, this thing is going to be in melee range of Merle, definitely.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Alright, I'll hit him with my war hammer, but we will discuss this in the off-season.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	All right, I'll hit him with my warhammer.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You, yeah, you club this thing with your bat and you hear it grunt and cry sadly and some pink juice comes out of it, and it hits the wall and is dead.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All three tardigrades burst open, and a million baby tardigrades swarm out—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You've exited the zero-gravity room and made it through the airlock into what looks to be the main lobby of the lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Which isn't crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is still in its normal, labby form.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there's a bunch of different airlocks leading to a bunch of different chambers from this like central hub.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can see an airlock leading to the main entrance of the lab— [Clint laughs] — what's wrong?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh... one of them is labeled to head to the main entrance, and that airlock is actually shut down, it's powered down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There's another airlock on the opposite end of the room that you can't really make out, that's also powered down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There is the airlock you just came from.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There are three airlocks leading to the med bay, one leading to-- one labeled to go to the main elevator, and one heading to a room called Cosmoscope.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then right next to you, right next to the door that you just exited from, is the airlock leading into the Thermal Regulation Chamber, which also has a layer of ice around it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But as you enter into the room, you hear coming from that door, you hear some banging and shouting and chopping coming from that iced-over door.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I start chopping too!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you get your ax out and start chopping on the other end of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I get my ax ready so I can help him.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I cast Sacred Flame on it.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, no, but you did teach the ice a quick parable about Pan and his divine guidance.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you blast the door with Fireball and Magnus, you're chopping away with your ax... Merle, you hear a voice in your head.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, it’s, uh… the voice sounds like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	All right all right, I turn around and look behind me.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You look behind you while everybody's busy get-getting to this door, heeding this voice that apparently only you can hear, and you see a small rift open in space, and you see the crystal with the white fire starting to come through it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And that voice says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the thing's starting to pop out of this rift-womb, and make its way out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I grab it.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you catch the crystal before it drops to the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, the rift closes up, and nothing gets crystallized, as you grab this white fiery crystal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you hear a sound like a light bulb shattering as the crystal in your hand just kind of, kind of shatters and fractures into splinters, and you feel a sharp pain in your hand.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And that sharp pain is kinda replaced by this strange numbness.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And your hand is starting to get— starting to change.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Hand is actually starting to turn— turn— the suit, I should say, around your hand and your arm, you can feel it, like it hurts a whole bunch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I can't even describe how bad it feels.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But yeah, your hand is starting to turn into pink tourmaline.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[overlapping] I turn around and chop it off.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	What's turning into crystal, the suit, or my arm?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The whole kit and caboodle.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It's growing up, it's up your wrist now, it's about halfway up your forearm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's like, already in your body, it seems like?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's going up ya.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[Clint: Okay—] It's about to your elbow now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I turn and say with a calm but manly voice,	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I turn around and chop it off!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I chop it off!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm gonna chop it off!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle floats over to you, Merle, and opens up your helmet and puts a little wooden spoon in your mouth.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And that is your last thought as a two-armed man, as Magnus brings Railsp— Magnus brings Merlesplitter down just above the elbow, and you hear a grisly cra- cra-snump.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He actually very artfully carves it just about where the crystal was—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Matter of fact, when he brings the ax down, I'm throwing the arm up in its direction.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm leaning into the chop.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your arm falls to the ground, and Merle, make a constitution saving throw just to see if you can like, stay conscious during all this.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You're down for the count.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Merle is unconscious now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He just falls backward, sees what's just happened and faints.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Killian and Carey have just, like, gotten through the ice and look over like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I pick him up and I run in the med bay.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You pick him up Rescue 911 style and run him over to the med bay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Maybe singing a sweet lullaby to him?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Wait a minute, who's carrying me, the guy that just chopped my arm off?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Or the guy that just let it happen?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I don't know how— uhhh, I will, as we're running, I mention to Merle that if we need a new arm, the good news is, he's got lots.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your whole party, the three of you— Merle, you're unconscious— with Noelle and Carey and Killian, rush in through the airlock towards the med bay as just chunks of this room that has become crystallized start to break up and start to— it looks like this thing is self-forming again, but you don't really stick around long enough to watch it put itself together into some sort of grisly monster.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	With Merle's arm floating in the middle.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, Merle's arm is actually part of the mix.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see this thing using Merle's arm as part of its form, but you don't really see how it ends up in the production.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And yeah, you hoof it through the med bay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you go through the airlock, before you actually get into the med bay, you reach a sign that says, “Decontamination Chamber,” and as you open it up, it's actually a pretty small chamber that has some medical equipment in it, and what looks like an observation bay, but this whole room has also been completely crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you pass through that, and through another airlock, you do actually make it into the med bay, and there you see Lucas, for the first time since you met him in the voidfish's chambers.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Lucas— Lucas has a big bandage on his head?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He has a big, like, bloody bandage on his head?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But he says, like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Before he can finish that sentence, Killian actually grabs him and picks him up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And is like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Carey's like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas grabs him like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I do it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I put him on the table.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, he starts to rustle around in a drawer—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It's full of spare dwarf arms, and he just like, sticks one on, and you're just fine.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The bleeding starts to slow a little bit, Merle, you actually wake up a little bit, you gain a little bit of consciousness as you feel this needle go into you—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But this thing is actually numbing your grisly wound pretty significantly.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It's bringing you some pain relief.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Killian's in the corner, she's using, she is speaking to the Director through a stone, and just like checking in, letting the home base know the situation, and Lucas asks, like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I turn to Lucas.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He rustles around and gets another syringe out and gives Merle another shot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[Clint laughs] you feel much more sedated.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He gets out a notepad, writes something down—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I bleed all over it.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	—and hands the note to Carey, and says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she says, uh,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	—and she grabs the note and just darts out of the room with blinding speed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	She's gone.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[Magnus: Aw…] And he's doing some work, the bleeding is stopped, he's wrapped a big bandage around it— Merle— so it doesn't seem like Merle's gonna die, and he goes over to a desk in his corner and he starts tinkering with some stuff.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes off his belt—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he's working with it, he's got this petri dish that he's like mixing some sort of fluid in... and he's like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Is it moving, are they moving towards us, as well?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Still?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, the— those two tardigrades are definitely gonna be in that field, just because they were sort of pulling you towards them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This thing, Merle is now— because of sort of the inertia's carried him forward— it's pretty close to you, so it's just gonna try and take a big bite outta ya.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It's sort of floating backwards, there's some, there's a couple— let me explain some of the things that are in this room that if you want, you could take advantage of.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This thing is scream-gurgling, and it's a horrible, horrible, horrible sound.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	That's what I say to it.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One is right next to you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So yeah, you're gonna launch yourself at this thing.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, the one that was all chewed up from the Roma zone?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	The child ax.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	The child ax, with all of the power.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So those two are gonna be blind.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So that's one down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He's not gonna be able to get close enough to take a bite out of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How close are they?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus yells,	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, so he's pretty much right up against the wall, so you push yourself off the fan blade and get to the wall, uh, right next to where he is; that would be a strength contest.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Now Merle, you got a fuckin' fastball special coming your way—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Well, so, it's going to enter the Roma zone for the first time.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you guys basically just did a, like a quick little baseball game.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You guys hear Killian and Carey going,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, fine, I'll use Fireball.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear a whisper come from behind you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as soon as you grab it you hear that voice again, and it goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as you open up your hand, you realize that you have a few little needles of this crystal sticking out of your hand.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, I'm— but I want you to know that Magnus, in character, is screaming, "Let me chop it off!"	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	I'm saying that in character, I have a history of arm removal.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	"Whoosh!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Clink clink clink!"	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Passed the fuck out.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear Lucas say,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	'Cause he's scared?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Full of spare dwarf arms...	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Uh, no, he actually pulls out a syringe and jams it into Merle's arm, um, and you— it regrows.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you're not in a horrific amount of pain anymore.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you shout 'give it to me in my butt!'	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Cuz that doesn't happen all the time!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Normally a much better equipped woman has to come in and save us.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[Clint laughs] That's typically the way we do it.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I'm just thinking this is like our bottle episode, where we just re-use the airlock set over and over again.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Just a little, just hang a different sign on it.	Clint

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	"Huh, that's weird!"	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Travis, that seems like a very personal character choice you're making for Dad right now.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I don't think you should decide whether or not he wanders this earth as a one-armed dwarf.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's fine, but you can't say you chop it off!	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He is an arm removal specialist.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So if we could figure out a way to make that work?	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That would be rad.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Now, I'm not—okay, that's not what unconscious people say, but let's keep moving.	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	YES	Is that where it bit you?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	Yep, right in the dick.	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I have a question—	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Is Magnus still poisoned?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, no.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, I was going to protect him from poison because I have— but I won't waste a spell on it if that's—	Clint

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	What is it?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You basically just begged him to.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I'm unconscious, thanks.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	No.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Late one night…	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Let's roll initiative real quick.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's a six.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Also six.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Also six!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, but I roll twice, remember?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	19!	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	[Clint laughs] Who's got the higher Dex between Taako and Magnus?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	My Dex is 2, 2 modifier, 14.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I mean, my Dexterity's 18, my modifier's 4.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I have a +7 to Acrobatics.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, first in the order is Merle.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And I don't want you to feel like you're railroading me, but I'm gonna make a Strength check.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	18 plus 2... That's 20.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	I got a 13.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	And that's your turn, right?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, tardigrades are up next.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	So they're going to roll a Wisdom saving throw?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I'll roll the one that tongued Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That's a 19 + 1, so 20.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That beats it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And the one that had you, Merle, [dice] rolled a 4.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That did not save it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	So he takes, what?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I roll 3d8... [dice] 2, 8, 8!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	So 18.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	That is a 14 + 6, 20... 20.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	So that's where I take my Armor Class, that's 18...?	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	Yeah, that is 12 points of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] Uh, gosh, that is... 21, it's gonna hit your AC.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	For 15 points of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So... make a Dexterity saving throw to get out of the way of his projectile black spit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It's 13+2, 15.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That's not gonna do it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[anticipating] 2 points of damage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That's it for the tardigrades.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next up is fuckin' flip wizard McGee, Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It must make a Wisdom saving throw, which, if tardigrades are Wisdom-rich, you can go fuck yourself.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	At the start of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 Psychic Damage.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	On a successful save, the spell ends.	Justin
MECHANICS		YES	So the start of its next turn, it would take that damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yes, correct.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice roll] It's a critical failure.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Magnus, you're up.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I'll give you Advantage on the attack.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	What kind of attack do you think it would be?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I don't really know how attacking with the shield— go ahead and make the, you're definitely proficient in shield, so...	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So that's 15+7, 22.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, one-handed is 1d8 + 6...	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Why don't you just do 1d6 + 6, we'll just take it one dice down.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That is 5+6, 11.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Well, I get a second attack!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That is 16+7, 23.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, but now they've got Disadvantage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I think that's a different thing.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	[wheedling] But that would probably give Disadvantage, wouldn't you say?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, sure.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Merle, you are next in the order.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You probably have to roll something.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	[mock upset] 20!	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	No, it's a 6.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Plus?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Plus 14.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	[laughs] No, it's a six.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order are these tardigrades...	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I guess I'll roll a saving roll against fire cream.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	They also, I'm gonna need the middle one to roll a Wisdom saving throw.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	13?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	4d10…	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Hold on one second, my lovelies, [Griffin and Clint laugh] lemme getcha 4d10 of damage.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	We got 3… 10… 5- 6- 16… and 24.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That is a 19 versus AC?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So make a Dexterity saving throw, Merle.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[Clint rolls die] With Disadvantage, because you don't have anything to get your body off.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So I roll it twice.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Take the worst result.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	15!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, that does it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's a 17 + 6, so 23, with Disadvantage [dice] 10 plus, 16?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Where's AC?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	This is a Dexterity saving throw, not a ranged attack.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	But I'll give you Advantage since he's blinded.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So I need to make a Dexterity saving throw?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yes.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	13...	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Plus your Dex!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	He has Disadvantage though, right?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, so you, I'm gonna give you Advantage, because I don't know how to do Disadvantage if you're the one making the roll, except just to—	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] And then we have 16.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Nope, neither of those [crosstalk]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Plus your Dexterity, are you doing that?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I added it.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	14 points of damage for Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Taako, you are up.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So you have to make a Constitution saving throw, [in unison with Griffin] for both of them.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, 12, we'll say that one was for the one back near the debris, that's not gonna do it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And then the one at the Roma zone… [dice roll] wow, Jesus, rolled a 7.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	A thousand points of damage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	4d8 Thunder damage.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	17.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	17 points of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, no, I don't think you can choose which way to push him, I think you just push him away— [crosstalk]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, you can!	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Can you?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Can Thunderwave pull it?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You're the one in control of Phantom Fist, Thunderwave is more like an explosion.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, yeah, so... next in the order is Magnus, you got one 'grade left.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, so that’s 16+7… 23.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I got a 19, which would've been good against a mortal man…	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	What does he do?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Wisdom saving throw?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	He has to make a Wisdom saving throw, yes.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	21.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Does he not still have Disadvantage?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	He does on attacks, not on Roma avoidance.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[laughter] Not on angel-dodging.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I get, I have a special called Commander Strike.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Merle, make a melee attack against this waterbear.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	What did I just roll for?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	17, and none of my modifiers...	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	That's what the plus 3 is.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	17, then.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	All right, my superior dice— [dice roll] so whatever your damage is, plus 4.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	5 plus 4.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	9 points damage?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Would radiant damage not help?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	[cracking up] I will give Travis Advantage on this roll.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled 15 plus 7, 22.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	And uh, go ahead and roll damage, Magnus.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Let's see... two-handed... [dice] That is 7 + 6, so 13.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I feel like damage should be reduced, though.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Constitution.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Nat- Natty 20, I can smell it.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	It's a one.	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	Is it really?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	My— I have really good acrobatics, I've just never used it for some reason.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	You are... you have been grabbed, so if you wanna try and get out of this thing's slimy, slimy grasp, you're gonna have to make a Strength check.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, so these are a bunch of little spirits that flit around, in a sphere of like 15 feet...	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Around me.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	And any creature— for one thing, their speed is halved in the area, and when they enter the area for the first time, they have to make a Wisdom saving throw.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant Damage.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	So they're all going to take turns now.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So I guess that's a hit.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	This spell is called Phantasmal Killer.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	But I have to make a save right now to see if I can get away from it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, that's a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	What's your ax do?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	But they're not gonna take much damage from it 'cause it's just a little fire extinguisher.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, they're blinded.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No, that is going to be a ranged attack.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It was gonna be, it's a ranged attack!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The one that got chewed up by the Roma zone is saved.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The one that— well, the middle one that attacked Taako did not.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And the one that attacked Magnus did not.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Hell no.	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	Now, to be fair— when he enters the zone, is his speed halved?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	No, but anytime it's in the zone, their speed is halved.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I haven't really been tracking speed because we're in a weightless zero-G-like inertia.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, that's what I'm saying, so he would've slowed down enough.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Taako?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	To try to get out of the way of this big black ball of spit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That ain't gonna do it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And that's it for the tardigrades.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Certainly not.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So now they're both gonna take—	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, yes, 10 feet away.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	[crosstalk] I think it would be in a trajectory away from me.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Any time I've done push with Phantom Fist, I got to choose where they went.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, so that— we don't even need to get to that turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And then he's using my second attack to do it.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, that's a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, Sacred Flame is sort of fire of a divine origin.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I roll— I roll a 15!]	[Travis
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	That's a critical miss.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Not so much HP relief.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, listen, you have to trust me.	Whisper
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's me, Pan.	Whisper
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You have to grab the crystal.	Whisper
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Grab it with your hands before it touches the ground!	Whisper
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can stop this room from getting crystallized!	Whisper
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can save your friends!	Whisper

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Check this shit out!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Guys, he's crystallizin’!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Noelle: GUYS!]	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let me chop it off!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, do you want me to freeze it?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Maybe I should freeze it?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't know if freezing it would do any good!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, it's better than chopping it off—	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, is that all Noelle did?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You bitch at us for not using her and then I try to use her and she just goes "Oh, poopie!"	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I can't–I can’t like...	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can't anti-crystal you!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Somebody do something!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Chop the damn thing off!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Chop it off!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just chop it off!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't care!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Chop it off!	[Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, wait, no, I got an idea!	[Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Chop my head off!	[Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Then I won't suffer!	[Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Griffin laughs] Here, chop off— here, right here, chop it off here!	[Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Leave the tattoo—	[Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bite down on this, you're not gonna like this next part.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why did Pan lie to me?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Griffin starts to interject; Justin is dying of laughter in the background] Oh, it wasn't Pan, was it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shhhhit.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, I'm so glad that you guys— WHAT THE FUCK?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't have any— my med— my med spray ready yet!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah, shit.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What just happened?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're close to the med bay, bring him in!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did you just cut his fucking arm off?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… Yes.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, fix my friend!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't know what happened!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What did you do to that dwarf?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You said you needed us to give you a hand!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Seriously, what did you guys—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This has been the worst, shittiest day ever, we are two people down, your lab SUCKS.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Fix my friend!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You better put me down if you want me to help him!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Killian...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, guys, can we take this thing— just bring it down just a little bit, let's figure out how to help Merle out right now.	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Help me put him up on this table.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus, use your big strong- your big strong- [Travis: Fishlifters.]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			arm-removing arms—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How ironic that your big strong arms are only good at one thing, and that's removing other people’s arms.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's very ironic.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			AAAAAAAH SHITTTT!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What has been goin' ON out there?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What are you guys doing?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What happened to Merle?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he uh-	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I got disarmed.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He started to crystallize, we were chopping on a door and magicking a door, then we heard Noelle scream, then we turned around, his hand was turning to crystal, and then his arm was turning to crystal, and I heroically - valiantly - chopped his arm off, against my wishes— he begged me— and I cut his arm off so that he wouldn't all crystal.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, listen, let me stop you right there.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas isn't your dad.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You chopped your dad's arm off.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You don't owe Lucas any explanation.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Get us the fuck out of here!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slurred, moaning] You dirty prick, I can't believe you did this to me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And now he's drunk.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh the pain, kill me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t- We can't get out of here, we can't get out of here until we manage to stop the base from sinking into the sea and crystallizing the whole world.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did you forget why we're here in the first place?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			'Cause I— well, I—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's been like four episodes, my dude.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's because I fucked up an experiment pretty bad.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But we— that's not, this, the arm thing's not on me, I don't think!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it was crystallizing—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I blame that on everybody!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, can you hear me?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[woozy laughing] Yeah?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why was your arm turning to crystal?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What happened?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slow, gasping] God... lied.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			God lied to you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slow, slurred] God liiiiiied to meeee.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You have the prettiest eyes.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yes I do, but focus up, what do you mean, God lied to you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'll say it a different way.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Godddddddddd liiiiiiiiiiied toooo meeee.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, there you have it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I guess God lied to him, that's what I'm picking up from the situation.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then some British guy [slurs] threw a crystal at me, and I grabbed it, and it hurt.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Some British guy...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I heard all of that, um, okay...	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I, I, it's that being.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's that being that's been attacking my lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't know what the fuck that thing is, but I'm so sorry that you guys had to get mixed up in this.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I didn't want any of this, you have to believe me.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think it was that guy that was married to Katy Perry.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Travis: Russell Brand?]	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sounded like that— Russell Brand.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sounded like Russell Brand took my hand.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, is Russell Brand here?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, he's not, hold on—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In my butt!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Give it to me in my butt!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There's a lot of shit going on, Lucas, [Merle snores loudly] that I feel like you're not being honest about?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Lucas: You’re right, I--] Like this— compact—?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, god, you went in my room?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I did, it was a fucking mess!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it looked like somebody stole all your gems before we got there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Clean your shit, dirty boy.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All my gems are gone?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, let’s- priorities!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'll explain the compact, I'll explain what you saw in there, I'll explain everything— we gotta get this guy taken care of!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He'll be fine!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tell me about the compact!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Carey, I need you to get over to the bugbears and tell Jamie Green to bring me these supplies right now, or you can bring them back, tell her to give you these supplies and get back to me as quick as you can.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you got it!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, Carey!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Whoa whoa whoa!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don't worry about it!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I've got a plan!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As much as I want to, we can't leave, we can't get him out of here until we stop this thing from spreading.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I, I, [sighs] I was down in the lower chambers of my lab—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			 One night, and—[Griffin forgets the words to "Monster Mash"] monster boy?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How does it— anyway— I was attacked by one of my robots.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I came up here to the medbay to, you know, treat my wound, and when I tried to leave, I found that crystal monster, or whatever it is— it's not, the monster itself isn't crystal, it's what's inhabiting the crystals— it attacked me in the decontamination chamber, and so I, I made my way back here into the med bay, and I flooded the room with anti-Conjuration energy because obviously, he's traveling between planes to move from spot to spot, [Magnus: Obviously.]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			so I blocked it off— obviously, come on, that's like, 101— you guys figured that out by now, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I, guys, I'm just so sorry, I promise, I'll get him patched up, I have an idea for how to patch him up, and we're gonna be able to, you'll see, we'll get out of this and we'll get down to my lower levels and I'll stop the crystal from spreading and— mission accomplished!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Great!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you guys will say, 'Good work, Lucas!	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Merle, you've been treated.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Aside from, you're missing your right arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And by right arm, it's mostly your forearm, it kind of just kind of stops at the elbow, and you're really thoroughly bandaged up on that arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Things have calmed down in the past, in the twenty minutes that have passed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There's some cabinets with medical equipment and medicines, there is some sort of scanning device, and there is a null suit chamber, much like the one that you guys had in the Bureau of Balance, it's maybe a little bit smaller than the one that you have in your lab that you used to suit up at the beginning of this adventure, and hanging off of the side of it are— is a suit, that is Lucas-sized, it is human-shaped.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas stops messing with this panel that he's fiddling with, and he goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Travis is telling his shield, "I don't know, I never cut his hand off… "	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus takes axes, kills arms.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes the right arm and he holds it up to Merle, and it's really little.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's like a small, like a doll's arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like a toy, like a GI Joe arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He actually goes back to that desk where he was messing around with a belt and a petri dish, where he was messing around, and you see him—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He unscrews this, like, cap at the end of it, and attaches it to this thing that he's tinkering with.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as he's tinkering with it, Carey comes back into the room, and she says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	And he takes that plant and removes it, de-pots it, takes it out, and as he's like taking it out of the pot and shaking the dirt off of its roots, you actually see the plant kind of protest?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He picks it up, and it just kind of looks like this wooden plant is hanging off of this belt.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he creates—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He creates some sort of concoction that he walks over to Merle, and he says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your other arm falls off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, so you're downing this bev…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It actually tastes more like a carbonated wheatgrass shot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It doesn't taste especially great.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas explains, he says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He starts whispering in nerd ASMR.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes this belt and wraps it around your shoulder, and then there's another fastener which goes around your chest, and as he's doing this—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I chop it off.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then Magnus and Merle engage in a very complicated like high five secret handshake so he can test out the hand, we do the Shimmy Shimmy Cocoa Pop, the Bureau handshake—	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it actually like kind of curls up towards you and gives you a big thumbs-up as if to say, hey!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	I'm your arm now!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus cuts both his legs off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Noelle says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The meters, you have these little panels on your wrist that are showing how much energy you have left in your null suits, are completely full up now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And everybody gets all sprayed down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You guys make your way out of the med bay and through the decontamination chamber back into the central hub.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This room is kind of a mess because the crystal golem started to form in here and kind of fucked shit up, as he was like breaking pieces of crystal off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you pass through the airlock into the Cosmoscope you enter into what you assume to be a pretty large chamber, although it is like, completely pitch black in here.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Save for a pillar of light which is illuminating what looks like a circular disk that is kind of free-floating in the middle of the room, facing you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And uh, Lucas walks into the back of the room, into the darkness.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, he flips some switches on this lectern and you see an image pop up on this disk, and it looks like the lab that you are currently standing in, as seen from above, from outside of the lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he points to this disk in the middle of the room, and he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he holds up two index fingers, and does, like, an iPhone pinch-- pinches them together, and the image pans out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he pinches the screen again.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s beautiful.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You’ve never seen anything quite like it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He walks to the back of the room-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	–he says, and he flips a switch on that lectern, and the whole room lights up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the disk in the middle that you were just looking at is made of some sort of dark, bluish-green material, in a perfect circle with some silvery trim all around it, and this disk is levitating.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they’re all arrayed in orbit around this central disk in rings around it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s ten other of these disks in the room and they’re all different colors -- bright reds and oranges and greens and blues and whites -- and they’re all displaying a wide array of scenes of impossible things.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You look into this red disk, [Magnus: Like what?]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then there’s a blue disk where it’s just a giant ocean, a world made of water and ice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And these, he points to these disks that are on the outermost ring away from the prime material plane disk that’s in the middle of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he goes:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s the meat plane, the vegetable plane, the dairy plane, the breads plane…	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Soluble fats plane…	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She’s like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, he says	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He flicks another switch on the lectern and the disks just start to sort of rotate around the central one, like they're moving like planets in orbit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	“I turn around!” No!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	“I’m turning around.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	We’re all turning!”	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uhm, as you all say that you’re turning around, as you turn around [Justin: out loud], out loud, you see, a floating figure in a bright red robe.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I attack it!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I blast it with magic missile.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, he’s incorporeal and your axe passes right through him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I attack again, I get two attacks per turn.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your second attack hits!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, and Taako,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I step- Magnus steps into the place that he is, and kind of blends in with him and goes	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He phases, he phases-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, now I do use magic missile.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He motions to all the different planes, and he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It actually kind of looks like a, kind of like a trash bin?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as he motions towards it, it tips over and some small gemstone disks crash out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This disk, this disk begins to shake and this horrifying black cloud sort of emerges out of it and it slowly creeps towards these disks that are floating in the room, and one by one, just consumes them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is an absolutely terrifying scene.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It consumes the prime material plane, and you feel kind of sick watching it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	After it has consumed all of them, this red robed figure snaps his fingers [snaps] and the cloud disappears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says, uh	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This, this, he’s starting to shudder.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna step a little bit away from Taako.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As he shouts that he bursts into flames and disappears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the lights turn back on and Lucas says-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle, uh Noelle has her little satellite dish scanner thing out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Its uh glowing green.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she says-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	 Yeah, uh Merle, between your sort of backgrounds in, uh, religion and arcana, you know that a lich is sort of this embodiment of a, a very powerful magic user, who uh, sort of uh, combines their essence, like life energy with their magical energy, and sort of transcends their physical form.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Technically, it’s like an undead- Imagine a ghost made of magic.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	But, that uh, a magic user has to willfully do that.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Except what’s interesting is, is that most liches, when a magic user does this, it’s like way too ambitious a thing, and they can’t really control that energy.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Most liches are just like, insane.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Like they have no control over themselves.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	They’re just hyper, hyper-violent, hyper-evil embodiments of like, raw magical energy.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	They are not usually well-spoken beings.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas also says-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The mirror on the floor that you actually, the black mirror, that you saw that black cloud come out of.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I get closer to it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as they sort of make eye contact with you, these eyes quickly shut, and disappear.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I pick it up.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I chop his arm off!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This room is not, also I should have mentioned earlier, it’s not crystallized with the pink tourmaline.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says uh-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, he says, he do not, he has no idea what	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	you’re talking about.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, so back in the sort of central hub room of this floor, Lucas walks over to the central pillar and it's got one of those like red, hand-lock things on it and he puts his hand on it and it makes a bing-bong noise.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says, uh:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Carey and Killian actually draw their weapons and they say, or uh, Killian says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas is like:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She points at Lucas.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then suddenly the whole room is blue sapphire.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Taako, you just fall to the floor, you are not moving.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You have been completely paralysed as you fall to the floor.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus, your like, head is good and your hands are good, but your arms and legs are both paralysed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Merle, just your legs are paralysed as you fall to the floor.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But all of you go down.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Carey and Killian go down like a sack of bricks.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And right as soon as that happens the elevator doors open, Lucas runs in, and as the doors shut behind him, he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he is gone.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Killian says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Both your arms are actually pretty good.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as that verse wraps up, another rift opens in space.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And out of that rift, that white fire comes out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And those loose pieces of crystal shards that the golem kind of abandoned when it left this room start to self-form again.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This one is actually, way more like, slender than the other ones you've seen.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It looks like weirdly like bony?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Almost like a crystal skeleton with these long, much longer, much sharper looking appendages.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And this menacing apparition comes and stands over the five of you all laying paralysed on the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	I lost my dominant hand.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So about twenty minutes have passed since you guys got Merle into this medbay room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, he is alive, and through a series of medicines and salves that Lucas has applied, you're actually pretty lucid, and the pain from your grisly wound has almost completely subsided.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What I'm trying to establish is, you're actually doing okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The bleeding has come to a stop.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, Lucas right now is actually in the corner, he's actually removed a panel from the wall of this medbay and you can see he's got some sort of like hastily constructed terminal that he's like, rewiring some stuff in the panels, and he's like, fiddling with this terminal, and as he does, you can hear sort of rumbling and some ambient noises coming from pretty far off in the lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And in this medbay, now that things have calmed down, you've actually got a chance to sort of take in your surroundings.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes it, and uh—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He's like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And she is holding a potted plant with these four wooden shoots, it looks like, coming out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Like it's like trying to slap his hand away?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he plants it in this petri dish that you can see has some sort of green viscous fluid in it, and he sprays it down with something.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But as you taste it, and as you drink it, you see this wooden— these four wooden shoots hanging off of this belt kind of come to a standstill and start to wrap around each other and tie around each other, and they form what looks like kind of a crude four-fingered arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as he's doing this, he is straight up, like, Army of Darkness, attaching this wooden arm to you that is now roughly the size— it's actually kind of bigger than your other arm—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, I don't.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, you have this wooden arm, and you feel this like, this psychic link with it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You feel like a deep connection with this arm made up of these four wooden shoots that have twisted around each other to form the shape of an arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, as you do the secret Merle and Magnus handshake, Merle, you feel like it is not a big deal to move this thing at all.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It takes maybe a little bit to become as dextrous with it as you were your original OG dwarf hand, but yeah, you have pretty good control over this soulwood arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I want it in the canon that Magnus is actually like a little bit jealous of his sweet new wooden arm.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Not out loud, mind you, but just quietly to himself.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Taako cuts his head off.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And I guess very awkwardly, because there's more of you now, you're doing like a Real World/Road Rules like, how many co-eds can we fit into a phone booth challenge... you all get coated in another layer of null-suit juice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Taako silently nods in agreement.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you make your way into the door that you saw earlier that was labeled 'The Cosmoscope.'	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see him get out a flashlight and you can see he's messing with some sort of lectern back there…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see it zoom out, and now you can see the Stillwater Sea underneath his lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as he’s doing this, you’re seeing the entire galaxy, spiraling.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you realize, as the lights go up, this room is filled with these disks.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	you see a world that looks kind of like the world, if the world was made completely out of lava and fire.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where millions and millions of these living lights just float weightlessly through the air and worlds where oceans of magical energy wash up on shores made of these brilliant white sands--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where everything's the same except everybody's got mustaches…	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can actually see underneath the disk that you were looking at first, where you’re looking at your own universe, you actually see another disk underneath it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, as you actually look into the plane of thought, which is this deep green emerald mirror, you see similar scenes to the things that you saw in the compact, Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a large, wide, gray road with a bunch of vehicles just sort of sitting stuck on it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see scenes like you saw in the compact.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plain plane, that's not very exciting.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plane plane, that's just full of planes.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the plain plane plane with all these plain planes in the plane.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is Merle’s arm there?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Actually, as he was talking about the astral plane, you realize he’s talked about 12 different planes but there are only 11 in the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Killian’s actually getting a little short-tempered about all this.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He freezes and time kind of [Travis: Well, you son of a-] time kind of freezes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, time has kind of frozen here.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The orbit of these disks has stopped.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and Killian, and Carey and Noelle have just kind of stopped, a- and from behind you, you hear a voice ask that question, uh and it asks-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus turns around!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[high pitched voice] I turn around too!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	But does he seem miffed?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh-nope!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Taako, you’re magic missiling him?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	No, I, well it depends, did I know he was incorporeal before, or did I watch him, Travis, attack first?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	If I watch Magnus attack first, I probably didn’t blast it with Magic Missile.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He phases sort of upwards so he’s floating above you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He waves a hand and uh, there is a crate sort of in the back of the room by the lectern.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One of them, you can see, is a very dark disk kind of like black.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you can see definitely like flecks of red and green and blue color in this black disk.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As each disk is consumed you hear like, screaming voices coming from it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This vision kind of leaves you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	There’s red electricity kind of crackling through him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And we turn around and he’s got his penis out!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	From where you’re standing, fairly far away, you actually see some like, faint, white moving shapes in it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Standing over it you can actually see what look like white eyes looking back at you through this, black mirror.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Nothing is happening.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No it’s not, it’s not uh- all these things, all these crystals an’ stuff aren’t spreading around.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm out the door so I can't hear this.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear an elevator sort of moving up to come to your level.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Killian's getting kinda aggro and Carey's trying to sort of-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As you're like arguing with like, Killian, um, you notice that this pool of, it looks like blue?	Griffin

NON-GAME_RELATED			I would do anything.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			To make it, more sonically pleasurable for the listeners.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I’ll just talk like I always talk, cause I don’t, that means I don’t have to do character voices like you guys, [Griffin laughing] or dad, ever.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			You can't just do any voice.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			You just told me to do a character voice!	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			It's not Rich Little plays Dungeons and Dragons.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Well, mommy, uh-	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			We don’t want a fucking tour of American history, just do one character voice.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Just do it!	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Well, you're doing a different character voice!	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Your Barry White voice.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Because my throat hurts and again, that's two to your zero voices.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Well, you're using up all the character voices.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Yeah, I mean the song is basically a mash up of that and the Forest music from the Super Mario RPG.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I've realized now in post.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Perfect.	Travis

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I've rewired and shut down most of the rest of my lab, it should buy us about an hour and a half to get downstairs and shut this thing down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That should give us about an hour and 29 minutes for you to explain what the holy hell is going on, and one minute to get downstairs.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sigh] There... [sigh] what don't, what don't you already know?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Some— There was an accident, and somebody—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oookay, what don't we know?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I got a compact, lets me see into some strange world, A.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			B, there's a voice that keeps talking to us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C, some British guy more or less took Merle's hand.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			D, what the fuck is happening?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, if you— if somebody got stabbed with a sword would you say the sword killed him?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was merely the tool that operated on Merle, through this British guy— I was a tool.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Actually, before we get started, Merle, I had an idea.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because we're gonna need your clerical ways as we go deeper, and I was thinking, I had a kind of idea of how I could maybe restore some of your two-handedness?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If that makes sense?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm listening.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm a little grumpy, [Lucas: Okay.]	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			as everybody can understand...	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus, I understand that you may have taken a little trophy from Hodge Podge after defeating him.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I see it?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uhhh gimme a minute to find it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Travis: Rustle rustle rustle.]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Not this one... not this one... not this one... not this one... this?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, not this one... is it this—?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No not that one...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it this one?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that's it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I'm just— I'm just kidding, that would be... that would be ridiculous, it's like a little toy arm.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like if I could somehow plug this into you, how would you control it?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's sci-fi bullshit.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Robot arms.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I have that arm back please?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I need a piece off of it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I'm back!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I got what you asked me to get from Jamie.	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, no, this is the idea.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is going to be great.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here, drink this.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Trust me.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is gonna be so sick.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is— Merle, I know you’ve been burned by people asking you to do stuff that maybe you don’t trust, in the past like 15 minutes, but trust me on this, this is gonna be tight as hell.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sure.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ll do it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm really down, so, yeah, go ahead, kick me while I— I'm vulnerable, I feel very vulnerable right now.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so biology's not my specialty, but this is definitely gonna work.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is a plant called soulwood, and it's a psychically tuned plant that can resonate with certain people that resonate with them, and it can sort of change its biology based on the whims of other living creatures.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Merle, from what I understand, plants are kind of your specialty, um, so—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Romantically.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Romantically speaking.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, my thinking is— do you mind?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm gonna get close, I'm gonna get intimate.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low nasal whispering] Okay, so what it's gonna do…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, how do you feel about auto-erotic asphyxiation?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so we don't have a lot of time for you to get acclimated to your new arm, so you're gonna have to figure it out on the fly, but before we get out there, you're gonna need to recharge your suits.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's right!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh gosh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry, I completely blanked.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And a little compartment opens up and a tank pops out that looks very much like the tank of spray that they plugged into the chamber when you first got sprayed down to null-suit yourselves.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Lucas slips into his null suit and plugs the tank into the chamber, and he's like,	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, everybody, pile on in!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's time to recharge!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas, while we're all showering together…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When Merle—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're standing on my thigh, which is weird.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thank you for the boost.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When Merle mentioned a British guy, did that ring any bells for you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I swear, guys?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The lying stuff?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is over now.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have no fucking idea what—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you realize that like this is an all-audio medium, so all I can do is ask questions, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can't look around and observe…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I get it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, if you want, I can tell you all about the compact…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That'd be cool!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It'll be easier if I show you the Cosmoscope.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you guys— are you guys ready to roll?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[voice strained and breaking] Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah... still in a lot of pain, but okay.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[voice breaking a lot] Let's do it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the tale of the... [stalling] old... sailor's... mummy!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I’m about to get into some pretty heavy concepts.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, I’m probably going to blow your whole mind and just kinda reshape the way you think about existence and stuff.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if it ever gets to be too much or you have any questions, please feel free to stop me, okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay wait stop: you’re blowing my mind.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boy, this is gonna take forever, I bet.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s take this slow.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My whole life, I have been obsessed with the concepts of taxonomy and hierarchy.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For everything that exists, there’s always a bigger thing that contains it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s always someone cooler than you, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s one way of putting it, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So there’s always a bigger thing that has a bigger thing that contains it, and so on and so forth, repeated on to just inconceivable degrees.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way up.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bigger turtles.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so this is my lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We can go way deeper on, like, the micro scale.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			To, like, elementary particles and stuff like that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But for the lightweight version of this demonstration, let’s start here.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s my lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so here it is floating over the Stillwater Sea --	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s that sea in relation to the neighboring landmasses, and here’s the whole continent, Faerûn.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s our whole world, Abeir-Toril.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How’d you do that?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just bear with me.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re gonna go way way further.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: What?]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s our solar system.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: Huh??]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s the local interstellar cloud, [Magnus: What?]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			the local bubble, the local arm, the galaxy…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s the local group -- [Magnus: I’ve seen it.]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Oh.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Laughs] Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I wanna actually ask you guys about that here in a minute, but here’s the local group, the local cluster, the local supercluster, and so on and so forth, until… Here!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the observable universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is everything we know, every place we’ve ever been, every person we’ve ever met, every place anyone’s ever been, is in here.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But more importantly, so are the immutable rules that govern the people, places and things inside of this universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Things like gravity and thermodynamics and arcane interactions.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And all that stuff, all that matter and energy and the rules that govern it, comprise this.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Our universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys are just a handful of people who have ever seen the observable universe before, so.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty cool, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, is there like a guest book we need to sign, or...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Deep voice] Hey, listen, uh, listen.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What if I was to take one step past what you’ve shown me here?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, can I say something?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s up?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve just made me very, very happy.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And also, just to clarify, horny.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			- and also, you have a deep desire to give me a lot of money.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve made me very horny.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, to answer your question, this is the next thing that’s bigger.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is our planar system.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, this, this disk, that you see, that represents our observable universe, this is actually our plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the prime material plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re smack-dab in the middle of the planar universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And each of these are different planes of existence, and they, they each produce unique energies and they share these energies.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They inform the material and physical make-up of, of, of each other.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They each have connections, some are more tenuous than others.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But these make up the real existence, uh -- each plane having its own sort of energies and rules.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, this is what’s bigger than the universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then what’s bigger than that?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, let’s start with this: There are six building block planes, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So you’ve got your elemental planes: Fire, air, water, earth.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then you got the planes of light and shadow.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: Heart?]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, certainly, you probably know a little bit about these during your studies at Wizard U.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low and raspy voice] Yeah, I’ve gotten balls-deep in some of those other planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think he’s got a secret room in one of ‘em.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When I use Blink, I get all up in those other planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s right.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When you use Blink, you end up in the ethereal plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn’t list that amongst your planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, there’s more.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m gonna run through them.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But if you actually look --	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That one is the ethereal plane, and it’s kind of like a filter.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like where the raw energies of the rest of the planes are kinda filtered into the prime material plane so it’s not just like, everything’s on fire or drowning all the time.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So yeah, anyway, that’s the seventh, and then we got the planes that sort of inform the energies of life itself, like the plane of magic where magic energy is born.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then on the opposite end of that, you see there’s the plane of thought which is the source of logic and reason and emotion.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Metal dragons!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like where the home of logical thought is.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s why I call it the plane of thought.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Show me Donald Trump!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t... know quite who that is.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Although, the fact that you guys make so many references to this world makes me think you have to have spent some time there at some point.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a little house there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t tell if you’re joking, which is like, kinda par for the course.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, there’s the other higher planes, there’s the celestial plane, which is inhabited by the beings that I guess some people would consider deities.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but you only wanna visit that one sometimes!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been working on a new version of the food pyramid, to kinda educate the people of Faerûn, but it’s kinda like a cube?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it’s for people who like to party.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, hey, listen, I gotta be honest.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			From me to you, that sounds dope as hell.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[continuing from before the comedic tangent] And then the prime material plane, the ethereal plane, you know about those.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then the astral plane, which is where our unconscious forms -- our souls -- retire when we die here in the prime material plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That goes completely against my theology.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is there a Pan plane?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please respect his beliefs.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, Pan probably kicks it in the celestial plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The astral plane -- so anyway, let me explain.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Crystals, certain types of gemstones, if grown into a perfect circle -- they can’t be cut!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If you cut it, it doesn’t work.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They have to be naturally grown in a perfect circle -- resonate with the different planes of existence.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			With the twelve planes that form our planar system, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, everybody knows that.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s 101.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Literally nobody outside this family knows that, until now.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I knew it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We talked about it yesterday.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You remember that, Merle?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Frustrated] Yeah, okay, so-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, when I wasn’t speaking to you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[lower voice] Hey, listen, little man, these guys are just being braggadocious.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t let them rattle your chain.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Go ahead with what you were saying.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m loving all this.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lay it down.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, anyway, my great-grandfather found a crystal, just like that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it was a perfect emerald disk that had just grown like that naturally in nature.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And through that, he was able to see into the plane of thought.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And using that, we may have gained a little bit of inspiration for our inventions here in the prime material plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Kind of cheating, I guess, if you wanna call it that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it possible that through tampering and connecting with these planes, that you might have gotten the attention of something that we shouldn’t have?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[instantly] Definitely not!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That really kinda feels like what’s going on here.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, yeah, my family [sigh], we’ve sort of led the Industrial Revolution in this world for generations now because of that mirror.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And so because of that, my mother, Maureen, started to sort of come up with this idea of how we can create other mirrors into other worlds.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it’s really hard to do, you know?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because you can’t, like I said, you can’t cut these gemstones to create these mirrors.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, if it was easy, everyone would do it, you know what I mean?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Exactly!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Everybody would have their own extra-planar sort of telescope situation.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you please, just, like, explain what thi- why you use the grand relic to do all this stuff?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cause these are, I don’t- this is cool and everything-	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was trying to grow another mirror for the ethereal plane.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yeah that's what I assumed I just kinda hoping he'd get to the point a little bit.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Read between the lines, Killian!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so,	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, she's not seeing anybody?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Justin: Nice try.]	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your mom is not like, dating or anything, right?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yikes, okay no she's-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Maybe Carbon dating?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is she a plant?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's his thing.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He nasty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean my mother was very, very much a botanist she, she sort of helped-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did your mom die, or die she like disappear one day?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She passed away, unfortunately.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Passed away into another plaaaane?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well yeah, into the astral plane, ‘cause that's where you go.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, I- so I was wor- we- I used the Philosopher’s Stone to transmogrify, uh just pools of water into these different mirrors, uh, it took me some experimenting.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I had to, to figure out which gemstones corresponded with which planes.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Man, I made so many gemstones.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I uh, yeah the result is I created these 12, I unfortunately was working-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was trying to get their trajectories right, and I accidentally broke the astral mirror, so I gotta grow a new one of those although-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Smooth move Ex-lax!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I very much doubt that you’re gonna let me keep playing around with that Philosopher's Stone, so I guess I'm just gonna have to cut my losses there.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, but then again, I get it when you want the complete set and you don't have it, and you're like one away you know.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, exactly.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m a collector too man, I get it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is what I was working on.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is what I was using the Philosopher’s Stone for.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is to create the cosmoscope which I could use to see the whole planar system, and Merle you asked a very important question earlier that I would also like to circle back to!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah, yes, what was it?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sighs] You’ve already forgotten.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Of course, that qu—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s bigger than this?	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I turn around!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, Ho Ho, I’m in a red robe!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, excuse me…	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh… sup?	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I spoke to you about the hunger of all living things.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, when was that?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The last time, in the office building.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In the-?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			With Bane Bane.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			With Captain Captain Bane.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, he tried to poison you.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But I st-	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He tried to poison us?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so a lot of things went unnoticed.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not remembering, that one is by me.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, take it on credit.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I warned you about the hunger of all living things.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mmhmm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the power it seeks.	Red Robe

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think we're all getting a big kick out of it.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Griffin: Um] Hey, by the way, I meant to tell you, this is a great PowerPoint.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A lot of people forget to give props for powerpoints [crosstalk]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s not as easy as it looks.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks, I-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s not as easy as it looks.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s a lot of aesthetic issue-	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I like the fonts!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I worked really hard on it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s some good clipart.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like free, fair-use clipart.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, that’s weird,	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I had my scanner on before, from before when I scanned that crystal monster.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s uh, I’m picking up- it says it’s.	Noelle

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A lich?	Merle/Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[cross talk]	Merle/Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like a lich,	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like a lecher?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t-	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A lich is like, uh, an undead, like uh-	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well that’s weird, did one of you knock over my rubbish bin?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I had some things here I was uh, these were some mirrors that didn’t end up being anything.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did one of you guys, like, come over and kick this over?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Cross talk]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, That does sound like us but, no…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-uh!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sounds like something we would do if we thought something-	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know, when we’re staying at someone’s place we take really good care of them.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So I don’t- Mm-uh, Not us!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Gruffer] No wasn’t me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I didn’t do it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah-nope!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re very careful about this.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I-hey Lucas,	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, what’s up?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I uhhhh, have this?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I don’t know, yeah I mean I guess it’ kind of valu- I mean it’s ethically unsound.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re not gonna, [ Magnus: Lucas] you’re not gonna sell it right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			(high pitched) HMMMM, no.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So that’s made of, lemme see.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s one made of black opal.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Which is, I mean it’s inert, it doesn’t resonate with any planes.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But, yeah, I guess if you want to keep it, you can hold onto that if you want.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I do!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, anyway, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s what I’ve been up to.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So uh, let’s uh- let’s-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The spirit, the spirit – uh, sorry Lucas, real quick, one second.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The spirit that we encountered talked about seeing beyond the plane [crosstalk]?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The what that you what?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, nice one.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Good one!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Smooth!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah there was a thing-yeah, because we know so much.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was a spirit, a thing!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That like inhabited golems that we’ve been fighting and that kind of stuff, that sang to us about seeing beyond the plane, and their crystal kingdom?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It really feels like this planar stuff, might have something to do with that.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was it-?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Gruffer] We’re sorry we didn’t tell you before, Lucas.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What songs?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What are you talking about?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[singing] I like to go there in my dreams, here in my crystal kingdom.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We should probably get a move on, because I think we're down to about fifty minutes now and yeah, we should really get scootin'.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey man, that'll be groovy.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's go.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay uh are you guys ready to uh, go down to the lower level?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys ready to stop this thing?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What, what is down there?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			One of my robots just attacked me, I don't know, I think we can stop them but I-I think-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh cool, robots, let's do it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I believe in the power of our friendship and teamwork that we can all do it!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Eh, well, maybe.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hell yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, the only place that you're goin’ is the pokey.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We've-	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, timing!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We've received orders- we have to get- we had to figure out what he was doing- do you not remember?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Our orders?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			From the Director?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I do!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you couldn't wait until after he helped us stop the thing?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm not gonna let him get anywhere near the Philosopher’s Stone.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't trust this dude as far as I can throw him-	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So what are you gonna do with him right now?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm gonna take him, we're gonna extract him, and we're gonna fuckin’ lock him in prison probably forever.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And you're just gonna leave us here to deal with this shit.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys can handle it, you're Reclaimers, we can't do it!	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If we get too close to the thing it might end up tempting us, it'll definitely tempt this motherfucker.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We're taking this guy to jail!	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sarcasm] I appreciate less help, thank you so much, Killian.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, guys, listen.	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We gotta take him away!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We gotta take him out!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle-Merle, Magnus, Taako… come on, help me out.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can help you guys stop this thing.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright… here's the deal.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			take him back to the lab.	Killian, Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lock yourselves in where we just were.	Killian, Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lock yourselves in.	Killian, Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Leave his necklace on him.	Killian, Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If he helps us get through this through communication- Lucas if you help, I will plead your case.	Killian, Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I will say that you were cooperative, that you were easily-	Killian, Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We don't have like, a court.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We don't- this guy used a Grand Relic.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he knew not to do that.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's- that's it.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, like-	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, uh, well, you know, good plan Magnus, but suddenly she just blew up your spot.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Way to play along, Killian, real smooth.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, super cool.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I don't tell you guys how to recover relics, you don't tell me how to regulate!	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You actually have done that before.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You have said, many times, that is-	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can remember six times.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, the first- the first time we met, yes, I explicitly told you how to recover relics, but you weren't on the- on the payroll then.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, you guys are good at this.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We're good at this.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We're- This is what we're good at, which is getting creeps away from destroying the fucking world.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You would be locked in a fucking frozen room if we hadn't come along.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's prob- We were-	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So don't sit there and lecture me on how you know how to do your job.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We're gonna get through this together, you got it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Killian, I’m sorry, I don’t even know what we were arguing about.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Fwiends?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, you’re gonna let us take this guy back and you’re not gonna raise a big—	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah no, that’s what we were arguing about, thank you, I completely forgot.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gang listen, we don't have time for this.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am so, so sorry.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, you know what, you dickhole?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like I was fighting for you, you ass!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am going to absolutely murder that man.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah...yeah, yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am absolutely going to kill him– oh my god I’m gonna kill him so good.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You and me both, Killian.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Great, now I can't feel my legs.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm down to one arm.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			One freaking arm.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[through a stiff jaw] Hey guys... hey guys.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			oil can... right?	Check it out
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oil can... right?	Check it out
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oil can... like the Tin Man.a t wee	Check it out
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think he’s saying oil can!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought he was saying [muffled]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well this is hardly fair.	Cockney accent

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You’re in null suits.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the crystal golem is, he hasn’t, like, just like outright attacked you since finding you in this vulnerable position.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He, uh, he actually walks over to Carey and Killian and kind of eyes them over?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as he looks them over, he waves one of his long, crystalline spear-like arms and, uh, what looks like a book, a large tome made of light, appears in front of him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He pays that- you no mind, to your shitty George McFly impression.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he - he is flipping through this tome.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Alright, so, so- this crystal golem is looking through some sort of book made out of light, and it’s flipping through it and sort of looking at Carey and Killian as it goes, and then it slams the book shut, and it disappears just as quickly as it appeared, and he says, uh:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the book reappears and he flips through it and he goes:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, he says uh:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	First in the order is actually the golem, uh, who - thank you - uh, who, uh, reaches over with his left arm - he’s got these two long, crystalline, spear arms.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He’s actually gonna reach over with his right arm, and he hits it against his left arm to break a little piece of it off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So he’s going to- after breaking a piece of himself off, he looks down and says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s going to attack you with his spear arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He- he misses.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I think I might cast dispel magic?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Well then I might try to cast dispel magic on Taako.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, I mean, you’re - it’s now right next you, like all your stuff is - you can move again, so.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’ll just scoop my crap up.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You scoop your crap up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m gonna- I’m gonna cast a spell at this guy.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Uh, I’m gonna cast Evard's Black Tentacles.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Uh...squirming bl- so I cast this spell and like black tentacles emerge in a 20 foot square all around this cat...what’s this fool’s name?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So, uh, I’ll let you know what is up when his turn begins, but for right now there’s just like black tentacles.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	There’s - there’s no response.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, she- she floats over to you and like with- with her uh her long hose arm - she’s being very delicate, and trying not to touch the crystallized floor.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, but she’s - she’s like touching, touching all around the suit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, uh she says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ok, yeah she sort of wraps herself around your arms and then it’s like you’re wearing a jetpack.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A Noelle-shaped jet pack.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she kinda floats you and stands you up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So like fuckin’ Weekend at Bernie’s [Clint laughs] she just sort of flails your arm towards him as you hold on to Railsplitter.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So then, I do that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I’m gonna use Goading Attack.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He’s restrained by beautiful ebony tentacles.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	They’re stroking the length of his body.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You actually-- you actually-- as those tentacles just sorta like whap into him, some some chunks of him kinda fall off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, before he does anything, that crystal that he broke off of his body earlier starts to shimmy and shake and glow bright white, and then it explodes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ok, yeah he breaks free from these tentacles.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ok, they, they, they fall off of him, giving him- giving him one last final soft graze.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he blushes…… and that’s his turn.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m casting Prayer of Healing.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He is no longer restrained by the tentacles, but the tentacles are still surrounding him.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Ok, then he moves out of the way of them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yes, he floats backwards a few feet.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	If Travis can’t move his legs, then I shall create his legs!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[Griffin laughs] I raise my hand into the air and I summon Garyl!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Arising from below Travis, are four beautiful, magical, uh, purple legs that seem to shimmer with a rainbow, and out of nowhere, materializing in air, are two beautiful horns, and like the voice of God echoing through the room and sending trickles of urine down the leg of this crystal golem are the words:	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she sort of releases you from her grasp and floats off a little bit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I must- I gotta, again, I do have to drive this point home: you are slumped over this horse.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He is– he can move you around but you are very much– uh, uh, uh, kind of dead weight on it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This golem is about eight feet tall.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The golem, uh, picks up-- he’s sort of standing on one leg-- he lifts his left leg into the air and he brings one of his arms down on that leg and two pieces of him come off this time that are sort of flanking him left and right, and they are both glowing white.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And, for his attack, he is going to take another stab at Merle.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So yes, his first attack looked incredibly powerful, but the shield as you sort of dropped it to the floor deflects it away and his second one misses heartily.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’m dispelling that magic on Magnus.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re flanking him--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re not that big, actually.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re about the size of like your fist, kinda jagged.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, cause he’s standing in between ‘em.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I hit the one on the right with the battle wrench.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, I mean you guys were literally standing right next to each other when you went down and you haven’t really moved much.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, he is up in the air with, uh- he’s up on Garyl.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you can easily stand up and reach him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’ll grab the fork out of the bag.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you plug it into this fist sized floating crystal in the air and as you do, it--your fork slides in as though you are piercing a bread roll.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you do actually you realize this particular piece of crystal is actually part of Merle’s former arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As it - but it turns into like one of those fucking awesome Red Lobster cheddar rolls.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I take a big bite and what’s it taste like?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It tastes fucking incredible!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s super buttery, super buttery.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Super, super soft.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Super buttery, super flaky.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s like there’s a sweetness to it?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Like, there’s some sort of sweet element, like a brown sugar, maybe, in the butter?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But it feels, it’s actually - it’s weird because, like, it wasn’t cooked, you magically transformed it into some sort of edible material-- It should just be like a meal ready to eat, but actually it’s soft, like it just came out of the oven?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s fucking incredible.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s really, really tasty.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it goes down real smooth.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I pop the whole thing in my mouth.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Having breaken broken parts of himself off, he’s actually looking really worse for wear.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he also takes like a step back from you, like kind of staggered.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The golem form falls apart, collapses on the floor, and you watch the white fire portion of him pass through a rift behind him and disappear.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Oh, hey, let’s get in the pocket spa.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You drag the still paralyzed members of your party into the pocket spa and luxuriate and relax and recover some health in a, a post battle debriefing, and--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, they’re more like loincloths, really.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re more like loincloths you just drape around your crotch.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	We’re not naked.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You’re loinclothed up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you guys take—take your rests.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, you are havin’ a good chill-out time.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you step out of the pocket spa back into the main elevator lobby.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says, she says, uh,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Killian feels the back of her helmet and says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I cast duct tape of Dormammu, and seal up her helmet.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, Noelle floats over to Killian and prints out, like, Conky’s secret word of the day…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	… a little map of the lab and then she pops out a little highlighter attachment from her frame and doodles on it for a bit and Killian takes it and says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Killian walks back out through the door back, back towards the bugbear encampment and is gone.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And, uh, Carey walks over and presses the button to summon the elevator back in the middle of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it—there doesn’t seem to be any sort of discernable clasp on it, there doesn’t seem to be any discernible, like, handle?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	To open it up?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s just this heavy metal grate now covering the elevator down to the lower levels.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I open it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, it doesn’t seem to—it doesn’t even, like, rattle or move.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I heal both of their hernias.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Carey says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	From above you, actually.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then you hear—and you see the elevator sort of shake violently as you hear what I can only describe as a smashing sound come from above.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then there’s- a quiet passes after this smashing sound, comes from on top of this elevator.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And there’s a second smash, and then a third smash, and…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I take this opportunity to get my Glutton’s Fork back from Taako.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, this—this—this elevator’s gettin’, like, destroyed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This elevator car, I should say, is gettin’ destroyed, the one with the heavy metal grate over it is gettin’ destroyed.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And that’s—as more smashes happen, you see that the source of this violent elevator car assault is coming from a bright yellow—what looks like another elevator car.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	… on either doors, and he says:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I get in him.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[hesitantly] I… get in him…	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You find a—in lieu of a proper elevator panel, there’s just sort of a fleshy series of nodes next to this door.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you press the one underneath and he goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you begin to descend.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, his—his fleshy interior doors open up and you are led out as he—he makes a barfing sound as you leave his tummy?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And this... the doors shut and he disappears.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The lab, you noticed when you were outside of it, has kind of a conical shape to it so it’s bigger on top than it is down below, kind of a Cloud City, Bespin thing going on?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So there’s not as much sort of area down here.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	but you are now in a much smaller, darker lobby.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as far as you can tell, there’s only two doors in this lobby.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This room, by the way, is not crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There is a very large, heavy looking, like, vault door that is all sealed up and it has one of those hand scanners on it that is lit up bright red.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then there is a—an even bigger sort of industrial door, sort of like you would find in a warehouse that trucks would drive into?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And this one is actually sealed up with one of those hand scanners that is green.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There doesn’t seem to be any kind of labeling going on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s red.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Is green.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I do that.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You look really cool.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Nice, and then I'm like,	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I cast Gust of Wind to make my hair blow up like [drown out]	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle takes a stab at the red hand scanner and can’t seem to do anything with it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She puts her—she puts one of her appendages on the green hand scanner and cracks it and that large, large, large door slides open and a gust of smoke and fog pours out of this cavernous robotics workshop.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is a humongous room with a number of really just gigantic pieces of fabrication machinery all around it and it’s all feeding onto this assembly line that connects all these different pieces of machinery onto a central conveyor belt that is running into a tunnel at the end of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there are tons of these scrapped robots lying all over the place.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus goes crazy!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Just pulling arms left and right!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But they’re just, like, laying all hither and yon.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This place is as messy—it’s as messy as Lucas’s private quarters.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, so there’s a bunch of these scrapped robots all over, just all piled up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What you notice about some of the robots, some of the more sophisticated looking ones, is they have little windows in their torsos.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And inside those little windows you can see what looks like a big, glass fuse kinda similar to the one that Noelle has in the middle of her chassis behind another window.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Noelle’s just kinda, like, lookin’ at these robots with these fuses in their chests and is kinda like, movin’ em around with her arm and just kinda looking ‘em over.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, the only thing you can kinda put together, Taako, is that not all of these robots have these little fuses built into them and the ones that do have more sort of vaguely humanoid appearances?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	To sort of compare them, the ones that you see all laying around with the fuses, as compared to Noelle, like, Noelle, like I said earlier’s kinda like rough-shod, she’s kinda put together of all these different component parts, constituent parts.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A lot of these robots are kind of approaching a sort of human look to them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus goes through the door on Garyl.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you move into the tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s actually dark as fuck in here, there’s, like, no lighting whatsoever.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And this conveyor belt is not running, there’s, like, nothing running in this room, it’s—it’s— quiet.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you go through, Noelle actually powers on a little flashlight in her body and is helping you all look around.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Lavender.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And yeah, she’s walking you through this tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s still quiet, although you hear what sounds like sort of a low-pitched wind coming from in front of you as you move down this tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And—almost as soon as she says that, you see a light in front of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then you see a second, and then a third ball of light.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But they don’t collide with you, they just kinda pass over and around you and as they do, you hear what sounds like, this sound of like, men, like, moaning sadly as they—as they fly by you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And move through the tunnel back into the robot factory.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they are three humanoid robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One is sort of massive, massively built, kind of gorilla-like.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Another is much more slender with a, what looks like a cannon for an arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And another one is very short and has what appears to be, like, a bunch of wires sticking out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And they all run at you and once they get within sort of spitting distance, they stop and you hear all three kind of laugh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And one of them goes,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	That’s the one, the big gorilla-lookin’ one says that.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the one with the cannon for an arm goes:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the short one with the wires sticking out of it says, uh:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it - this golem actually looks at Noelle the robot and goes:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then suddenly that piece is floating in the air sort of right next to him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So he has this little shard of himself floating next to himself.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, you have basically you have control of your top half of your body.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Because your hand was not paralyzed you have- you didn’t drop any of your stuff, um, so you still have your, access to your warhammer, battlewrench, Lil’ Choppy and the Extreme Teen Bible.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So, uh, yeah, okay; Taako, you are - you feel this paralysis, uh a bolt of purple energy sort of darts away from your body and shoots off-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[Clint laughs] Uh, but yeah, as you- Taako you feel yourself able to move once again as a purple streak of energy shoots off your bod and hits a wall and shoots some sparks off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You - you did drop your stuff as you fell down, because you - you had that full paralysis, but you notice actually while you were down your - your Umbra Staff - your umbrella was actually like moving with a mind of its own, like opening and closing in a way to like very subtly to scoot it back towards yourself.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Uh, so I don’t have my - I’m like empty handed right now?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	You don’t know.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But, um, otherwise you’re stuck as- stuck as hell.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	I wanna- yeah, uh, okay; I’m still wearing the necklace that lets me talk to Lucas, right?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh huh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, you actually hear uh the sound of like shattering glass.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then nothing.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, he is- it sounded like he actually destroyed whatever instrument he was using to talk to you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are the tentacles gone now?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They are yes, he’s free.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	I’m like, blacked out, right?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But yep, you have regained consciousness; this is a very turbulent roller coaster of a fight for you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	What you going to do?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, yeah, Noelle was starting to give up the ghost a little bit, holding up your full weight, Magnus, so this comes as a relief to her.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You are now mounted in combat, full-blown Bran style.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	How tall is the golem, Griffin?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Alright, we’ll say you fucking, like, slump your dead left arm over and throw the Shield of Memories, uh, to like sort of block the first attack as the second one comes in… [dice roll] and is a fuckin’ two which is not going to hit, with modifier.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, you have wrist control now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Hold on, how big are the crystals?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[wheeze] You’re just sitting on this horse who’s like--and I imagine at this point Garyl would be like, “So did you need me for something, or..?”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And then also, you know, Merle attack one of the crystals.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	On the left one or the right one?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I’ll use my plant side.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	That’s, yeah--it’s not very much damage but it’s enough to shatter this thing and it falls harmlessly to the floor.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Uh, how close am I to Travis’s bag?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Okay, are you doing this, Taako?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Are you doing this thing?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Hell - hell yes I am!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, you just kind of plug that bad boy in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	And you’re doing this into the crystal piece that’s floating, not the golem himself, right?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yes.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yes.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The golem, who looks pretty worse for wear after the last round of combat and now having sort of taken, breaken, broke, breaken?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are there monogrammed bathrobes?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Alright, you guys are in the pocket spa, you’re all loinclothed out, you’re havin’ yourselves a good time.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are we naked?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But yeah, you have recovered from the paralysis.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, you’ve got, about 30 minutes left.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	I assume like, Carey and Killian are, like, also recovered from the paralysis?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody’s good to go.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Everybody’s like—everybody’s rockin’ in the free world.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as you approach the central elevator that Lucas went down after paralyzing all of you, you hear Carey gasp and she points at Killian’s helmet and on the back of Killian’s helmet you see a small crack that started forming after she fell to the ground from the paralysis.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	When the elevator that Lucas went down shows up and the doors part, there is a metal grate, a heavy metal grate, now covering the door as it opens.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Oh, and you do.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear a sound come from the elevator, though.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it is smashing it down and crushing it like a tin can and pretty soon, this locked-off elevator car just falls and replacing it, you see, now appearing in front of you, a bright yellow elevator car with a big, bright red nose, and two big white eyes…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Taa—Magnus, are you still riding Garyl at this point?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yes.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, you have exited out into another sort of lobby area, although this one is a lot smaller than the one that you were just in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What color is it?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And the hand scanner to the robot room is..	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Is green.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are they close enough together that I can get both hands on them at the same time?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Pops an arm boner!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, this would be a good place for you to do that ‘cause there’s hundreds and hundreds of robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	And you can kinda put together that, like, if anything, Noelle was sort of a prototype to whatever these are.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Okay, you—Noelle is a robot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re actually like, embedded in the torsos of most of these things so you’d have to take, like, the whole thing and it would be.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What color is it?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What looks like a floating ball of light in front of you that appears from around a corner.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see three floating balls of light and they fly at you fast.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	From behind you, where the lights went, you see three shapes appear in the tunnel behind you.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	So when last we left you guys off you had been paralyzed by Lucas’s uh trap, set in your Null Suits.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	Merle, you are just legs paralyzed, the rest of your body’s good to go.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s not- he’s not using your arm as his arm as because it would be like little, like a baby’s arm.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Um, but yeah, it’s definitely in there somewhere.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Probably not.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Based on what?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, I don’t - I really wanna make that work for you narratively speaking, but it is now just a big, it’s a piece of crystal in the shape of your arm.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Cause if we could make him give the finger with my arm… I dunno.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I mean we could retcon it and say you were giving the finger as your arm was being crystallized so it’s permanently… blastin- flip- giving you a cold one between the shoulder blades.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yes please.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	To see if I can free him up.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Shouldn’t I- shouldn’t I yell something out?	Clint

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Breakfast damage is the most important damage of the day.	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Thank you dad!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Thank you, dad.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So what—so I—I guess what Griffin’s trying to say is we killed that crystal thing a lot faster than he thought we could.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	If the conveyors connect everything, then we could go in the robot room and it would probably take us to Lucas’s room.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Do you think?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	But it’s—it’s right there, she’s saying.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	She’s saying it’s through the	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I’m not sure what to do here, ‘cause I’m - my head can move, and my hands can move.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Is it the suit is locking me in place, or is there magic - like, could I fight against the suit’s, like, lockdown, or am I just frozen?	Okay; let me ask you this, Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	Um, well you did already fail sort of the contest, and that’s how you ended up paralyzed.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, okay, yeah; Taako, you’re back, you… it’s a good thing you didn’t stand up, ‘cause you would have fallen right back down when your health went below zero.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Taako, do you have any dispelling magic?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, I don’t actually.	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	So I bought it at the Fantasy Costco: “Once a day, the fork will allow the user to eat any non-magical item they can fit in their mouth and gain 2D6 points of damage.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	But isn’t that magical?	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I thought what he meant by non-magical item was like an enchanted sword or shield or something.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, I do want it back.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It won’t be with-- I will want the fork back.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Would you say picante?	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Why don’t you take a short rest because you guys need some health.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	A lot of people are wonderin’ how many times… I know you at home are wondering how many times.	Justin

MECHANICS		NO	Seventeen.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Fourteen, but I can’t do shit.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	And he rolls a 5, uh, plus 7 is a 12.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uhh, it is your turn, Merle.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Cause you can only target one- one magical effect in range.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Or one magical creature.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Or effect.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And then we’ll say the DC is 13.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Alright, that’s 7.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Plus your spellcasting modifier is 6.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Is 13.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Is 13.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, and it is your turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Uh, next in the order is Magnus?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Um, if you wanted to spend your turn trying to like conjure up the willpower making a, uh, trying to do like a constitution save as your turn, I would allow that.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Um, yeah let’s say this is a melee attack.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I’ll roll for Noelle, you roll for Magnus-	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And we’ll take - we’ll take the lower result.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So it’ll be like disadvantage except coming from two different attackers.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	We’ll put your same modifier on it though.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, I rolled a 14 plus whatever your modifier is.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Ok I rolled a 12 plus my modifier, which is plus 7, so 19?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Ok, either of those is gonna be a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, that’s a 6 plus 6 so 12.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, um– next in the order is the Golem -	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	When attack lands, um– superiority dice plus damage equals the wisdom saving throw.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	On fail, target has disadvantage on attack not against you.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Five plus 12 - a 17.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, that’s a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No, you have to do a wisdom saving throw.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Oh, and I have to beat a 17?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, I rolled an 18, um so before modifier I beat it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, it is the golem’s turn, is he about to get…?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	He needs to make a dexterity saving throw, and you’re gonna need to beat 18 is the DC on this one.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	K. Uh, 17.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That’s not quite gonna do it.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	So he’s gonna take 3D6 bludgeoning damage.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Six, six...	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	...five.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	So that’s gonna be 17.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	And I need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw, and everybody who is still even a little bit paralyzed has disadvantage on the roll.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Ten.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Eight.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	What’d you get?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Sorry, what was the- what was the, it was dexterity you said?	Justin

MECHANICS		NO	Uh, everybody is going to take a lot of damage from this crystal bomb.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That’s 5.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's 13.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That is 18.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	I mean I’m still at 46.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	And I’m at negative 8, so…	Justin
MECHANICS		YES	And what are his options, strength or what?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Strength or– dex, I think.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	We’ll do strength.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That is a 21.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Your turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each regain hit points equal to two D8 plus your spellcasting modifier.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Alright, I rolled a 6 and a 7.	Clint
MECHANICS		YES	And my spellcast modifier is 6, yeah?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	So 19.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	We get 19 points back each.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Taako, it is your turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	For how many points?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	19.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Your heals by the way, Juice, they start from zero, so don’t include the negatives.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You are at-- You should be at 19 right now.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Ye-- I should be at what?	Justin
MECHANICS		YES	You should be at 19 right now, when you get healed, when you’re below zero, then you -- hey, when you took that big hit from the big crystal bomb, you didn’t go to half your max health underneath it, right?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Like if your max health is 40, you didn’t go to negative 20?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay good, cause that’s an instant death.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I was at negative 11 and my max is 50.	Justin
MECHANICS		YES	Is that all for your turn, Taako?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Magnus, it is your turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, it is the golem’s turn then.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[die roll] Uh, that’s a crit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Can I force to reroll with my protection shit?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	You guys are pretty close together and this is a melee attack.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	“When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll--”	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That was his turn...uh, Merle.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, you still gotta roll to contest it to beat a 13.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It’s a 2, Trav.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	With my modifier though…	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	With your modifier of eleven.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It’s an eight.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	“Use one attack to command an ally to make a weapon attack.	Travis

MECHANICS		NO	Go ahead and roll damage, plus your strength modifier.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Just tap the fork on the item and it will turn edible.”	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah No- magical items are items that cannot--can’t traditionally be destroyed.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Like a magic sword can’t be destroyed.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Yeah, I don’t think you’re gonna need--I was trying to think, is this a fork based attack?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Wait hold on, he gets 2D6.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Health back.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	For the Glutton’s Fork, when you eat it you get two D6 points of health--	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	4 and 3 so that’s seven points of healing.	Justin

MECHANICS		NO	So you can keep rollin’ too, dad.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You can roll up to eight, eight times.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	‘Cause you guys haven’t taken a short rest this chunk.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	I rolled a 2.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	What’s your initiative?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Is that something you can cast?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I have dispel magic.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Roll it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You can’t move if you decide to stand up, because standing up is a move action, but.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Is that a spell you can cast?	I’m gonna ask you a dad question
MECHANICS		NO	For sure.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, and it’s conjuration, which is right in my wheelhouse.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, transmutation’s your wheelhouse.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	We’re taking a lot of liberties with what can be considered an action in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, but I’m very much into it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, ok, so we’re gonna say that that’s one handed.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	We’re not gonna call that two handed, but.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yep.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, and he’s also restrained.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	He can use his action to uh, to make a strength or dexterity check against my spell save DC.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	On a success you free yourself.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I’ve got lots of hit points.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	So he has to spend his turn trying to escape from you, right?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yes.	Justin

MECHANICS		NO	No, that didn’t happen to me.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, if we’re doing this, and you’re going to be doing a moving attack past him, then I’m going to call that an opportunity attack that he gets on you if you’re moving past--	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Since I’m on Garyl now, I’m going to delay my turn ‘til after- ‘til after Merle.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Can I do that?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I mean, the horse can’t move you if you’re delaying your turn cause I was counting his movement as your movement.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Okay, you’re delaying your turn until after Merle?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yes.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uh– I– maybe.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	I can do Dispel Magic again right?	Clint

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is—I’m—I—oh my god.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the most frustrating thing that’s ever happened.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All I’ve wanted in life up to this point is to find Lucas and destroy him.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I don’t think it’s safe for me to go on much further with this—with this here crack in my helmet.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you wanna swap helmets?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, that seems like—I, your sweet head can’t get crystallized either!	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Dumb-dumb!	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s already pretty thick.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s a really sweet offer, Magnus, but—and it is technically your fault because, like, we were just about to bust this perp when you…	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeeaaaaah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… when you started kibitzing.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, but I… I gotta be honest with you guys, I don’t think it’s that smart for me to get close to the relic to begin with.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, that’s not your job, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s like our job.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I mean it’s up to you guys to recover that stuff and I, um… I haven’t really told you guys this, but you remember when we met and we recovered that gauntlet together?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I really wanted to grab it and take it and put it on?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And get fire p- fire powers.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like I really…	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I gotcha.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s—	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know how to describe this.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was like, when you guys ran up and grabbed that thing, I was like, ooh, I kinda wanted to like, kill you?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And have it?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For me?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does that make sense?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, we all—	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Totally.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We all wanted that.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We just didn’t.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We rose above and that’s the important thing, you’ve proven yourself…	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, but I was about to definitely not rise above.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does that make sense?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Like, I was like… I was like, I have…	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] You just ran out of time?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You got distracted or somethin’?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been there.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, I really… I don’t think it’s that good of a call for me to get in there and grab it.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How about this?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How about a new job for you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You and Noelle get the bugbears outta here to safety.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If it’s okay—I’d—I’d kinda like to... I’d kinda like to see this through.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can tell you how to get ‘em out, though, we should be able to, um, figure out a path through the lab to extract you that’s not crystallized.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But I need to… there’s somethin’ I need to figure out, um.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So I—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it math?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I know all math, I'm a robot, so…	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can just like, punch that into my Windows, sort of my MS-DOS calculator brain.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But yeah, um, I’d like to stick with you guys if that’s alright.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I'm gonna—I guess I'm gonna head out.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Carey, be careful.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just get these guys to the—to the finish line, don’t you know, don’t be a hero.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I’ll see you guys back—	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Carey, if you wanna be a hero, I mean—we could use at least one.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wouldn’t say no.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ugh, I feel, um, I feel considerably less good about our chances now, if I'm being completely honest.	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But, uh, let’s do our best out there, guys, huh?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, we didn’t ask, but thanks, Debbie Downer.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I guess we should just turn back and go home, mission failed, right guys?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, we did our best!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, we did our best, no harm in that!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All you can do is your best!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think somebody’s been listening to too much Adventure Zone.	Taako/Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You don’t wanna—you don’t wanna be like those guys.	Taako/Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Carey, go check that out.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, kids!	Upsy

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I heard a rumor that you kids needed to go to a different floor than the one you’re on now!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You heard correct.	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know who that is, I'm just an elevator!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come on in my belly!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Press my buttons from inside of me!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mm!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[happy chewing noises]	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why is it so wet in here?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mmm, why indeed!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I might be metal on the outside, but inside I'm a real living boy!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m Upsy your lifting friend!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Upsetting my lifting friend.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s a good joke!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Which way are we going, kids?	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			D… Down!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s go down!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Aw, down’s my least favorite!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ahoo-hoo-hoo!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That tickles!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Justin shudders]	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How’s your day goin’?	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I could do that for you if you want it to!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Happen!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[scream singing] The girl from Ipanema’s coming to take your stuff inside your house, here she comes!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[normally, which isn’t saying much] I haven’t heard this song before!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re doin’ great.	Travis/Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve never had a horse before!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You still don’t, my little man.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm just riding inside of you, possession does not figure into it.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yo, are we there?	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Justin wheezes] I don’t know where we’re goin’, but like, I would like to be of use at some point.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re doin’ great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[pause] I'm very proud of you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, my favorite part was that hour we spent in that spa.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So what are you goin’ downstairs for?	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just general downstairs-y stuff.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, just stuff not up here.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s stuff down there.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just goin’ down there.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you gonna need a return trip anytime soon?	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause I got my soaps to catch up on!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, we’ll call you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			0, though.	Not—not between the hours of 4 and 5
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause of your afternoon soaps?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, my elevator stories!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are they any good?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, are they any good?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t understand!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s another joke I do!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, bye, I love you!	Upsy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so, if Lucas is anywhere, he’s gonna be in the main experiment chamber and that’s through that circular vault door.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If y’all wanna get a move on and…	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s the big door?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well that leads to the robotics manufacturing center.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That one, please.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All of the—oh, are you sure?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All of the rooms on this floor are sorta networked by this robot delivery system, so robots, as Lucas and anybody in the lab needs ‘em, those robots are gonna be put together in the manufacturing center, and then we have like a conveyor networking system that delivers those bespoke ‘bots to wherever you need ‘em.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sounds like a fun room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I mean it’s pretty cool.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like my—for me it was like my nursery, you know?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What do you think, Garyl?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ll be honest, I don’t know what you’re tryin’ to achieve.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean the robot room sounds– cool, to me, but the other thing, who’s the—Lucas?	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you hate him and wanna kill him, what’s the story there?	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I legitimately don’t know what you’re trying to achieve.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, you know, it’d take too long to explain it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause I don’t remember.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			About seven episodes too long, my dude.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What do you think, Taako?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, open Lucas’s room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey guys, look!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako stepped into the quantum leap accelerator and vanished!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Remember?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			From the intro!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Guys!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does this help?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Guys, remember?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, boy.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Quantum Leap, oh boy indeed.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now do the robot room!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, okay, okay!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle, any thoughts you’d like to share with us in this moment?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I haven’t… I haven’t actually been in here in a while, I don’t.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know what most of these are— I don’t know what’s goin’ on with most of these.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But we should—we should—let’s get a move on, let’s go through—that tunnel is the robot delivery system so we can go through there and that should be able to get us into the main experiment chamber.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey—hey, Noelle, I noticed that you have a sort of fuse-looking thing, similar to some of these other robots.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s—what’s that all about?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, it’s just one of my power units.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t really—I don’t actually—I don’t actually know that much about my own sorta, y’know, my own sorta machinery, but, um, yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas has always just told me that it’s just another power source inside of me, so.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, we should, guys, we should really get a move on—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, wait, wait.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			—we don’t have that long.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Look at me.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Look at me, Noelle.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm lookin’.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re better than any of these damn junky robots.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I'm the only one floatin’, I guess.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, alright.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So don’t be lookin’ at them and gettin’ sad!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, well—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You are my special angel.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, thanks.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Garyl, onward!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, I should be able to get us there, there’s a few twists and turns we need to make, but, um.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shouldn’t be too complicated.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god, I can’t believe it’s you guys!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god, I can’t believe I get a second stab at this!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yes!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is going to be a lovely little rematch, isn’t it?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right, motherfuckers.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s time for round 2.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[As George McFly] Hey you - you leave them alone you big stone bully.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Falsetto] “I say we let them go.”	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle!	Travis

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I cackle right back!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He reaches, well, he can't reach into his pocket.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Jenkins says, uh,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Jenkins is this little robot, kind of spherical... he kind of looks like a Fry Guy a little bit, except that he has all these individually moving, waving wires.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The spell didn't seem to have any effect on Noelle at all.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The bad news is that Taako and Magnus, you have been Confused.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm going to charge the gorilla one.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I'm gonna try to axe into that panel in the front with the fuse in it.	(Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	So yeah, I guess I'll just like two-handed Railsplitter that shit.	(Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you bring your axe down, you sort of do a horizontal hard chop, and that glass is made of way way way way sturdier stuff than you thought.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's basically like the shit that they put in those big tanks in aquariums.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you don't even leave a scuff mark on that shit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm also going to use Goading Attack: when attack lands, dice plus damage equals Wisdom saving throw.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Did I do any specific damage to the glass panel?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Next in the order is Maarvey, who says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He rears back one of his giant fists, this fist is like the size of your torso-- his frame like I said is like heavily armored, very tank-like, he's got these two sort of small bent legs that-- is not really holding up his frame as much as his two arms with these two giant fists at the end of them, is.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And he doesn't seem to have any kind of like, discernable head.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	His fuse is just right in the middle of his body, and it is now cracked.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But anyway he rears back one of these gigant-- ginormo fists- [crosstalk]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I duck.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	and he sends you flying backwards, make a Dexterity saving throw for me.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	I-- how about a little, can I take the edge off of it, maybe?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And literally nothing happened.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	We do need to resolve the fact that Taako, when you were Confused, the spell you were channeling to summon Garyl ended, and he vanished underneath Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And when your eyes kind of adjust as this thing stops blinking and these robots are still kind of looking up at it, you see Carey almost like hanging in midair with her arms outstretched with two daggers, one dagger in each hand, which she brings down in a cross-chop on Maarvey's back.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	--very successfully performs a sneak attack on Maarvey for, [dice] Jesus, [more dice] for 28 points of damage.	And  (Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She buries her two blades in his back.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a shower of sparks shoot out of these two wounds, giving him almost-- spark wings, and she does a backflip off of his back and lands behind him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I think it would only be Merle, is the only thing that would be nearby you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So go ahead and make a melee attack on Merle.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Were you just bashing him with the Umbra Staff?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Do you have like a dagger?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Or what were you doing?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I have a short sword.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Merle's not within five feet of me, is he?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, no no.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he casts Fireball.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So he's gonna kinda point it at the ground in between all three of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	-- expertly leaps into the air and avoids a fireball that consumes-- [mutters] oh, I need to roll for Carey--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So Magic Brian literally like lifts up his cannon arm and grabs his wrist and fuckin' cocks it, and then fires this gigantic burst of flame at the three of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Taako, you dodge out of the way, and Magic Brian seems very impressed by that, but yeah, Magnus, you particularly just catch this one real bad.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You're lying on the ground like a starter log.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Jenkins looks at how bad off Maarvey is and casts Stoneskin.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Where am I in relation to Magic Brian?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So you got knocked backwards quite a ways, you're about maybe... [tongue clicking noises] 20 feet away from the three robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And then with my attack, I'm going to pry his arm off.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And then my second attack, (Magic Brian: Uh oh!)	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm gonna hit him with his own fucking arm.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, I'm gonna say, he just channeled Fireball through that arm, and I don't think you're gonna be able to cast another Fireball out of it, but there is definitely like, this arm is still hot to the touch, and there seems to be like-- you know how like when people use a flamethrower, and when they use it, there's still that little spout of flame that comes out after they're done?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I shove that into the glass in his chest.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I'm gonna put that gout of flame into his chest.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You put this thing right up against the fuse in the middle of Magic Brian's chest, you fuckin' cock it and uh, release all of the leftover fire magic in his arm and you just blast the thing in the middle of his chest, and it does a ton of damage to him, and his-- that glass fuse kind of shatters, and the white sort of floating light that was inside of it pops out, and is now floating in between the two other robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear him go:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then he, this white ball flies into the same fuse that Maarvey is inside, in the little wiry ball.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear Maarvey go--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He's going to attack you anyway because you murdered him in real life.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He is going to charge at you and do like kind of a Thunderclap with your body in the middle of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, he hits you real real hard.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You feel a little bit woozy after that one.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I am no longer bloodied!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I-I do that.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm moving away from Taako and I'm moving towards Magnus and I'm kind of, I'm kinda hiding behind him a little bit.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm cowering.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Carey does a little gymnastic roll to end up right behind the now-conjoined Jenkins-Brian bot, and she is going to grab a big fistful of those wires and just kind of drag a knife across 'em to give 'em a little-- give 'em a little rude haircut.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She hits them for 15 points of damage, and you hear both Magic Brian and Jenkins yell at the same time:	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you saved.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you see a little toaster attachment pop out of that robot, and two pieces of bread pop out of him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	So the two robots that are left, how close are they to each other?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They are very very close.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	These three were standing, like, shoulder to shoulder--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, right now, Jenkins and Magic Brian are like, super uncomfortably close.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I reach into my bag...	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I reach into my bag, and uh– I pull out a single glass sphere.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I say,	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Then I throw the glass sphere at them.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There's no longer gravity around them.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, this is especially effective on the gorilla robot, because like I said, he was sort of, all of his center of gravity was based up on his fists, and now that he does not- no longer have that, he is like kicking and flailing like a little baby up there.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The circular wire bot, you see those wires sort of extend and expand and retract, trying to find purchase on this conveyor belt, but it is not doing an especially great job of steadying itself.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I scurry back behind, I run away, and hide behind Merle, behind Magnus.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear Jenkins like-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He casts Haste.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then you cast the best buff ever.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Jenkins still has control.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Jenkins says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And his 28 wires all point at you, Magnus, and they spark up, and he casts Dominate Person as he--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	--as he rolls up a fuckin' fat 420 blunt.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I am-- I'm gonna grab those 28 wires.. and I'm gonna swing the Jenkins bot into the Maarvey bot.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They're pointing at you from this floating wiry body.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	I'm picturing like a Fry Kid, is that the right--?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, you throw the wiry bot that held Jenkins and Magic Brian into the big ol' gorilla bot that held Maarvey, and as they collide, the wire bot takes all that damage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The Maarvey-bot does not because it has the Stoneskin, it takes half that damage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So now all thr-- you see these three fuses-- you see these three lights inside of the fuse of the big gorilla Maarvey bot and you can't really distinguish between them anymore, it's just like glowing very very very brightly, and you hear just sort of the three of them fighting amongst themselves.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are we in sort of a confined area?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The Jenkins bot, robot is like… pretty li’l, it's about shoebox size, so I don't think it would have enough force.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It was the tiniest of the three robots so I don't think it would have enough force to, like, do that kind of wrecking-ball damage to him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	But the good news is, I get a second attack, (Griffin: Yeah, and now all--) --and I'm gonna punch the shit out of that gorilla bot.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm gonna Phantom Fist the fuck out of it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Would you say it still pushed it, though, because it is floating.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you push it a little bit, but not enough to like kill it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Maarvey is going to take a swipe at you, Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He's floating--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I duck.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, he is going to have disadvantage because he doesn’t– he can't like, put his feet on the ground and turn into it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Nope, all right, yeah, you block his blow with a shield.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, it does not do very much, again, because of his Stoneskin, but it is enough to make Maarvey-bot give up the ghost, quite literally, as the fuse in his chest explodes and the three ghosts come flying out of him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Magic Brian says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Jenkins says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Carey shouts at you, Merle, but like, whispered--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Magic Brian-- holy shit-- Magic Brian also does not clear it, Jesus, the three of them just kind of turn into beautiful particles, the white light just sort of starts to fade away.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Magic Brian says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And they start to disintegrate and Jenkins says,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	So what's up with [crosstalk] --They got any gold?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You strip some copper wire out of the wiry robot, and you think you can sell that for some fuckin' meth money, baby.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You do have Magic Brian's blaster arm, still.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Which-- it seems dormant now, but you can still feel a bit of magical energy still coursing through it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I hand it to Taako.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Let's move forward down the pipe where we were going on the conveyor belt.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Yeah, is she kind of stunned by my obliterations?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, she's actually pretty blown away, she's like,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Noelle, actually, is being extremely quiet.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And she is just kinda floating sullenly [Travis: Oh, wait a minute…] away from you down the tunnel with her flashlight on.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says, um... [trails off]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She actually starts laughing.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The fuse pops out of her chest.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Pops out of the bot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it seems to be floating in midair, not like smoothly-- it's almost like the spirit inside it is pushing up on it, like, imagine a bird sort of like moving its birdcage just by flying really hard into the top of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This is like an extreme amount of effort that this soul is using to push its fuse upward into the air.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you see it move its way over into the pile of parts that you left on the floor that were the robots whose asses you just kicked.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	and you see that mech, you see that robot stand up and pick up the wires and sort of tie it around its back and you see it pick up one of the arms left over from Magic Brian's robot, and strap that onto itself, and take some of the plating off that one, and take some of the plating off the old Noelle bot--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I throw the Buster arm and say,	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a fucking port open on this robot's side that catches that Buster arm in mid-air.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	3 on that one.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Six.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So it's a 9.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Carey.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Wow.)	And  (Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Do I need to start off rolling a d10?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yes, you do.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	8.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	If there's no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It's a 19, plus 4!	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Go ahead and roll damage on that.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's gonna be 5+2, so 7 points of damage.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	So all of you need to make a dexterity saving throw, and I'm gonna say Magnus, you're gonna have disadvantage on this since you are prone.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] Okay, okay, well, that's another critical miss!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled 11.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I got a 22.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I actually rolled a 19, which I felt pretty good about.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	24 points of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	24, you said?	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	On each one of us?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Not me.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	In this game, clerics can cast buffs on the other members of their party, to like, make 'em more survivable, and keep 'em from getting hurt and taking damage or making them more-- it's like a really good thing that clerics can do.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch-- [crosstalk]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	--as hard as stone.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So, all physical attacks, Maarvey has resistance to.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Magnus.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I'm not gonna let you do that with an attack.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	If you want, as an action, to try and pull his arm off, but for you to be able to deal damage and --	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I'll give you, it's gonna be a pretty high check, but I'll give you advantage since you have the crowbar thing.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well that's a 19 plus my strength is a 26.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Can I, Griffin?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uhhh, yeah...	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's another 19.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	What's Faerie Fire?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, go ahead and roll, uh, 3d10.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	6.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	1.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	10.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	17 points of damage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Maarvey.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Do I have to roll to save against your shit?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Against your Goading Strike?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No, you’re just– it just is that, from now on.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Forever?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I mean, until the battle's over.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That can't be right.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[checking the rules] Oh, sorry, until the end of your next turn.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Okay, well, that's still this turn, right?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah.)	(Travis
MECHANICS		YES	He rolled a 19 versus AC?	(Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Well, that's a tie...	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Tie goes to the runner.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice roll] 15 points of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And next in the order is...	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] 5... plus 2, so reduce it by 7, so I only take--	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	8 points of damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Merle.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Up to six creatures of my choice that I can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 plus my spellcasting modifier, and since I'm using my last number 4 spell slot, if you're using a spell slot of third level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, so an extra 2d8 on top of the normal base amount.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And the 6.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	So I'm rolling the d8, it is a 6, so 4 times 6 is--	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	No, you gotta roll all 4.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	...That means, 23, and that means each one of my compatriots and myself get 23 points of healing.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Well I was down to 3, so...	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	You've gotta roll a Wisdom saving throw.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That is a 16 plus...	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	All right, next in the order is Magic Brian.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has Advantage on dexterity saving throws and it gains an additional action on each of its turns-- [crosstalk]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	 But it lasts for a minute, which is ten rounds of combat.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Magnus.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That is a twenty.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	You actually have advantage on that roll since you're actively in a fight with this thing, but you cleared the save, so-- Spoiler alert, they added that caveat because Dominate Person is bad, bad stuff.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It's your turn now, Mag.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Remind me, what's the Stoneskin?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Stoneskin is, they have resistance to melee damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	In addition to that he also has Haste, so he has +2 to AC, advantage on Dex saving throws and an extra action on his turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	What do I need to roll?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled a 15 plus 7, 22.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	What did you roll?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The attack was a 15 + 7 because that's my combat- my attack bonus, so 22.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Just roll one d10 plus your modifier.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled an 8, let's say that my damage modifier is a +4.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	That is a... 14+7, 21, does that hit?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	It does not.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No, it doesn't hit his Stoneskin AC.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That would be a hit... [dice] that probably isn't... 16?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Nope!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	If attack missed, attack plus the superiority die.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That is a-- [mutters]16, plus 7- 23?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yes, that is a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Excellent, and then, it's just a standard melee attack, so we'll say, one-handed Railsplitter... [dice] [mutters numbers, leading to:] so 10 points of damage.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, they get to roll a Wisdom saving throw.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Do we need to roll Need?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Check the loot table.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I roll Need.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	He is level 8!	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Huh?	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	How are you guys doing, while I roll four different initiatives?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, sure, why not.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Jenkins actually goes first.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, Griffin, real quick before I do that.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	12 is good, it's in the top 50%!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	The good news is that Merle and Carey cleared their saving rolls.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	This is a fun spell and we're gonna resolve it when we get to your turns.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	In fact, let's go ahead and get to the resolution right now, because Magnus, you're up next.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Oh shit, okay, you can act and move normally.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's a mis-- no, just kidding, that's a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	On fail, target has Disadvantage on attack not against you.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Well, yeah, I'll do the damage first so... 1d10 plus 6... That's another ten.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Well that's-- that simply won't happen.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, so 16 damage, and then Disadvantage on any attack not against me.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, I'm gonna actually demand that you say something to goad him while you hit him.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	He hits you for... he rolls a 24?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That does hit.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Well, I'm casting this in my sixth-level slot.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	You don't-- You definitely, definitely don't have that.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well then I-- I'm casting it as a fourth-level slot!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	On a successful check, the spell ends.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	And then I add my spell modifier... which I believe is a five.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order--	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, with an 8, you are going to use your action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's a good-- hey, that's a solid hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	There's a lot of dice on Fireball.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, a lot of dice.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, I'm bloodied.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	But just barely.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	You can blow on it on your turn.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Let me tell you what Stoneskin does, because I know you're wondering.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It's like a-- so let me explain.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	We'll make it, this is my standard action then, instead of an attack.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	We'll say this is a very powerful use of the spell Firebolt.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	What was the attack?	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	What kind of attack was it?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, hurting?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Hurting gorilla slaps.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, okay, but it's just like... he's punching me.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	He's doing a Thunderclap, it would be bludgeoning damage.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	when hit, use superiority dice to reduce damage by d8 plus my Dexterity.	I'm gonna use my superiority dice to do Parry
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Carey, who does a little--	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That is a hit...	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is... Taak-o.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You can save out of this.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	If you– if you do good!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Oh no, I'm sorry, it's Jenkins.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, that ties with the buff, with the big guys, so you'll do damage to both of them.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Riposte!	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	No, not till you reach level 8.	Travis

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I've gotta say, I am so psyched for this rematch.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have been looking forward to this for, well, since I was vanquished.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I gotta say, I'm so glad to be here with you two bros!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My two main men, Jenkins and Maarvey!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm just so psyched to have this opportunity to whoop some, to whoop, to whoop their rudey-poo asses with you!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's just have a good clean fight, and may the best robot win, I suppose!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magic B?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you a ghost in the machine?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It would seem that way.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You kicked me very good.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I remember the following.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I cast a magic missile at you, Taako, and then you cast one back at me, and our friendship, our budding friendship was betrayed.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought that we might have a good thing going, and I--	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If I was still living, I would have reached into my pocket and shown you, I had a wedding invitation for you to come to my marriage ceremony.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And instead of RSVPing to it, you murdered me.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What's death like?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's pretty chill.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You go there and you just kind of float around in a big pool made up of like, the sort of collective memories of everyone who's ever lived.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's like-- it's pretty chill actually.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But I prefer living, and you know, I was so close to getting my hands on that sweet, sweet Phoenix Fire Gauntlet, so, you know, Daddy's gotta get his.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, you guys could just go and... now you've got these new robot bodies.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We don't have to fight and kill you again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As good as that sounds-- I would love to get back to my usual sort of M.O., my daily routine...	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a beautiful garden that I need to go back and tend to, I have some--	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sucks in air through his teeth] Oh...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			---some begonias that I--	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[strained] Oh, no.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What's wrong?	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, nothing, your garden is great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How would you know how my-- oh, you've been tending to it since you murdered me?	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Totally.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It seems like the least you could do, after getting my ass thrown off the back of a moving train, is see to my plants and my begonias and my fruits and my lilies.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They're all fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are we fighting or what?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah, we can-- let's move on to that.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cause I'm actually--	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I feel like, listen, I'm not here to dictate the narrative, but I feel like we've really explored your individual arcs pretty thoroughly.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'd like to get to the part where I shoot you in the chest with an acid arrow.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's too bad that you're going last in the initiative order, then.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, do you remember how easy it was to kill you the first time?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I plan on doing that again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, you chopped me--	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[simultaneous] And we threw your body off a cliff!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Off a cliff!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your loved ones will never find it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They probably have no idea you're even dead.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[simul] Hold up.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hold up.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hold the phone.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because right now what you just said?	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was racist.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because I know me and Barbara sounded alike.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But I'm Maarvey.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bub, listen.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, bub.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I-- Barbara told me the raw deal you gave him, when we were over on the other side, and it was rough stuff.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn't throw me off--	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How did we kill you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't even remember.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn't throw me off a cliff or nothing.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm too tough for that.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You cut me in half!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It didn't register.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It wasn't even that big-- it wasn't even in my top 10 kills.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, let's see if I can make a mark in that book on my-- in my-- [stutters] fuck-- hey, fuck you!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know what?	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's actually see if we can't start-- right-- let's see if we can't-- let me get my pen out and dip it in the old inkwell and start writing down something in my book--	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I'm doing my best out here!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hellooooo!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	All
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Peace!	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[poof noise]	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry, Merle!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	All
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I've been working on my Magic Missile for a while, would you like to see it?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you left off the word "Merle" at the end of that statement.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh no, I wouldn't attack you, Merle, we've got no beef here.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks, buddy!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who's ready to see my new and improved Magic Missile?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I actually am, I say from the ground.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] I like magic!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm just kidding, that's some level one shit!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[wailing] Ohhhhhhhhh, nooooooo.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[normal] I'm just kidding, I can't feel anything.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But uh, it is a bummer!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well damn it.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I had such big plans, I was-- I mean that was very cool, you, you blew me up with a– like a robot gun, but I had such big plans for, for the robot bodies that I found.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I-- I was going to return to my love and we were going to finish our wedding, but uh... apparently... the best laid plans of mice and men and all that, yes?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am just going to, just, one second, I'm, I, do you, do you mind if I... this might get a little uncomfortable, but do you mind if I--	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, come on.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your foot's on my butt, and my butt is on your ear.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is clumsy and ridic-- there's only enough room for one in here.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We're just nuts to butts in here.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is, this is wholly unacceptable.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, just so you know, I'm not doing great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Merle, real quick before she moves, you should move!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Use your move action, get away from Taako, he's confused as shit!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come towards me!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Good!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have the whole protector thing that I never get to use!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I know!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Aaaagh!	Magic Brian & Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, first off, some apologies are due to the stabbed parties I have so grievously wronged, I am sorry about that, darling.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There's that sweet voice I've missed so much!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're on the list, bucko!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bad news for you!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You better hope you have a lot of robots.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a question for you, my dear new friend.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm ready to let bygones be bygones, just answer this one question for me, sweaze?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sweaze?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Taako: Sure.]	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's French for please.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Taako: Mh-hm.]	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Would you like the fish, or the beef?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			At the wedding, you mean.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes, yes.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm a vegetarian, actually, so... do you have a third option, or...?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I um... no.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, we'll have some sides, some hearty sides, and of course some sweet bread rolls.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But I'll send you a link to my registry later.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I asked, I had a toaster on that registry, but I no longer think that that will be necessary.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know, you two remind me of somebody.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who...who's that?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You remind me of the babe!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh shit!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh god!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I'm not confused anymore.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pretty much figured it all out.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, life?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All right, let me see if I can control your-- do you mind if I-- let me just take control of these-- can you give me control of, like, these fourteen wires, and you can have the other 28?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You just give me these fou--	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes, okay, God, yes, you can have– let me rewire, let me route you access to-- okay, let me open up the packets and the kernel-- okay, fine.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You now have access to those 14 wires.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please use them wisely, those were some of my favorite wires.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Time to bring out the big guns!	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, good going, Maarvey!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You really proved yourself there, Arnold!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Good going, strong man!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I did my best, okay?	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm a dead guy inside of a robot, I'm new, I'm learning my body, I'm going through robot puberty, I'm learning all kinds of stuff about myself-- Are you there God, it's me Maarvey!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't know how my robot body works.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boy, you guys are just absolutely hopeless.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm going to go find another robot to get inside.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, can't you like, do some cleric stuff?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can't you like, channel the divinity or banish them or something?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hm!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes, I can!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I cast Turn Undead... and destroy the undead.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boogity boogity!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What is he saying, what is the boogity-- [screams]	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wow, Merle, I didn't know you had that in you!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was some savage shit!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I didn't either!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… I did kill all three of them.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No you didn't!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no, Magnus, you did a great job too, I mean, I	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			definitely--	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I destroyed the robit bodies.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I definitely loosened the lid of that there pickle jar, but let's-- you know what?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's split the-- we'll split it four ways, we all did-- Oh, sorry, five-- five ways, Noelle, sorry...	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pst!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Guys!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle's a spirit in a robot body!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ohhhhh man.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She's got the fuse!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She's gotta be real bummed out about this news!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, go talk to her.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C'mon, guys, we gotta move on, we're almost- we’re almost there.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle... [Noelle: Yeah?]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I recognize now that you are a spirit, in a fuse, in a robot body, but I want you to know that I appreciate you as a member of this team, you've helped us a lot--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] I can't-- I don't-- I don't know what you-- I really don't know what you're talking about.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, whenever you're ready.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, holistically speaking, you've gone from being a sentient AI to being a soul trapped in a machine...	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think it's a zero-sum game, [Magnus: Yeah] you didn't have any illusions about your own agency, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is this like, funny?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is this, like–[Magnus: No!]	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			are you joking about this?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I'm not joking, I mean, I, I mean, you thought you were a robot before, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[heavy silence] ...Oh, no.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, gosh.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Someone's really stepped in the old spectral doo-doo now, eh?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um hm...	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I-- I did-- I did-- I died.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[“Hogsbottom” starts to play] Oh my God, I'm remembering now.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--I-- my name is Noelle Redcheek.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My family runs a cider press out in- out in Hogsbottom.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was ridin' our donkey into town and I was making a delivery to some dive bar, the… it was The Sleeping Giant.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it was in town, in Phandalin.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we heard--	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Never heard of it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we heard screams from outside and there was this man, he came downstairs, he called himself- called himself Bluejeans.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus gasps] And he was so kind, he told us to hide in the stockroom and he-- he-- he hid us and he fought off this dwarf that was on fire, and he got him out of the bar and we thought we were safe.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then the whole world got burned up.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sucks.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That is bad news.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Woof.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Woof.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Whoo.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hate to hear that, you know.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m so sorry.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah, too bad.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm so sorry.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But what matters now is that you're technically alive.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, no, not technically...	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, literally, technically.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She, you're in a techno body so you're technically alive.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm sorry, I just remembered, I was in that back room and everything was getting burned up, and I remember my last thought was that the whole world was getting destroyed.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And the fact that I'm here, and y'all are still here...	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought the world was ending, I thought my whole family was gone, but the world's still here, right?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's still here!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Phandalin not so much...	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's parse the question.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was your family in Phandalin?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, they're out in Hogsbottom.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do y'all know what happened to Phandalin?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, no...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I heard-- you just said that it burned?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You said that, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, yeah.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[choosing words carefully] We are part of the people that try to keep things like what happened in Phandalin from happening.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Merle: Yeah, yeah, yeah.]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We have... a pretty good success rate, if you don't count that one, which, we can all agree, was a world-class boner.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Clint laughing] Now, if you want to keep what happened to you from happening to other people, it is imperative that you aid us down here in completing our mission.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In this.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In this thing now.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're saying that this thing that's turning this lab to crystal is trying to do to the world like what happened in Phandalin?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can save the world, Noelle.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All right then.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's fuck 'em up.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Heeeell yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Take-- Let's go to fuck-up town!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hero time.	Noelle
