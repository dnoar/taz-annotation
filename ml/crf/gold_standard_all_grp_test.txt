IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I've gotta say, I am so psyched for this rematch. I have been looking forward to this for, well, since I was vanquished. And I gotta say, I'm so glad to be here with you two bros! My two main men, Jenkins and Maarvey! I'm just so psyched to have this opportunity to whoop some, to whoop, to whoop their rudey-poo asses with you! Let's just have a good clean fight, and may the best robot win, I suppose!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magic B?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes?	Magic Brian
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Break!	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you a ghost in the machine?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It would seem that way. You kicked me very good. I remember the following. I cast a magic missile at you, Taako, and then you cast one back at me, and our friendship, our budding friendship was betrayed. I thought that we might have a good thing going, and I--	Magic Brian
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He reaches, well, he can't reach into his pocket.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If I was still living, I would have reached into my pocket and shown you, I had a wedding invitation for you to come to my marriage ceremony.	Magic Brian

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Awkward.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And instead of RSVPing to it, you murdered me.	Magic Brian
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[all snickering]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What's death like?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's pretty chill. You go there and you just kind of float around in a big pool made up of like, the sort of collective memories of everyone who's ever lived. It's like-- it's pretty chill actually. But I prefer living, and you know, I was so close to getting my hands on that sweet, sweet Phoenix Fire Gauntlet, so, you know, Daddy's gotta get his.	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, you guys could just go and... now you've got these new robot bodies. We don't have to fight and kill you again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As good as that sounds-- I would love to get back to my usual sort of M.O., my daily routine... I have a beautiful garden that I need to go back and tend to, I have some--	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sucks in air through his teeth] Oh...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			---some begonias that I--	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[strained] Oh, no.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What's wrong?	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, nothing, your garden is great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How would you know how my-- oh, you've been tending to it since you murdered me?	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep. Totally.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It seems like the least you could do, after getting my ass thrown off the back of a moving train, is see to my plants and my begonias and my fruits and my lilies.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep. They're all fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are we fighting or what?	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[music starts]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Jenkins says, uh,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah, we can-- let's move on to that. Cause I'm actually--	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I feel like, listen, I'm not here to dictate the narrative, but I feel like we've really explored your individual arcs pretty thoroughly. I'd like to get to the part where I shoot you in the chest with an acid arrow.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's too bad that you're going last in the initiative order, then.	Jenkins
MECHANICS		NO	Jenkins actually goes first.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	He beat a 17?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Horse apples.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, Jenkins kicked ass.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Jenkins is this little robot, kind of spherical... he kind of looks like a Fry Guy a little bit, except that he has all these individually moving, waving wires. And then his fuse is sort of embedded in the middle of it, and you can see it behind a little circular window.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	His fuse starts to glow really brightly and some sparks start to shoot off of all those different wires that are poking out of his spherical body, and this weird wave and kind of like a, a supersonic sound comes out of him, and I'm gonna need all of you to roll a Wisdom saving throw.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Uh, Griffin, real quick before I do that.	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Yeah.) does this count as robots, which I have told the shield about before?	Would the Shield of Memories... (Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	12 is good, it's in the top 50%!	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Yeah.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The good news is that Merle and Carey cleared their saving rolls.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The spell didn't seem to have any effect on Noelle at all. The bad news is that Taako and Magnus, you have been Confused.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, what else is new?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	This is a fun spell and we're gonna resolve it when we get to your turns. In fact, let's go ahead and get to the resolution right now, because Magnus, you're up next. Before you do anything, my friend, I need you to roll 1d10.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That's a 10.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Oh shit, okay, you can act and move normally.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah! What was the deal?	Travis

STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[dice]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That is not good. That was a critical miss.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you bring your axe down, you sort of do a horizontal hard chop, and that glass is made of way way way way sturdier stuff than you thought.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's basically like the shit that they put in those big tanks in aquariums. And you don't even leave a scuff mark on that shit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay well, time to try again with my second attack... [dice] That's a lot better, that's a 19 plus 7, 26.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	That's a mis-- no, just kidding, that's a hit.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[Travis: Son of a bitch.]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm also going to use Goading Attack: when attack lands, dice plus damage equals Wisdom saving throw.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	On fail, target has Disadvantage on attack not against you.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, yeah, I'll do the damage first so... 1d10 plus 6... That's another ten. So 16 damage, and then it would have to be a 22 Wisdom saving throw.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Well that's-- that simply won't happen.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He's-- I mean, Maarvey was not a smart man to begin with, and now he's inhabiting a giant gorilla robot body... [dice] Yeah, no.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			I, I do not save... [trails off indistinct]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, so 16 damage, and then Disadvantage on any attack not against me.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, I'm gonna actually demand that you say something to goad him while you hit him.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, do you remember how easy it was to kill you the first time? I plan on doing that again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, you chopped me--	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[simultaneous] And we threw your body off a cliff! Off a cliff! Your loved ones will never find it. They probably have no idea you're even dead.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[simul] Hold up. Hold up. Hold the phone. Because right now what you just said? That was racist. Because I know me and Barbara sounded alike. But I'm Maarvey.	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bub, listen. Listen, bub. I-- Barbara told me the raw deal you gave him, when we were over on the other side, and it was rough stuff. You didn't throw me off--	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How did we kill you? I don't even remember.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn't throw me off a cliff or nothing. I'm too tough for that. You cut me in half!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh! Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Sorry. It didn't register. It wasn't even that big-- it wasn't even in my top 10 kills.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, let's see if I can make a mark in that book on my-- in my-- [stutters] fuck-- hey, fuck you!	Maarvey
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Travis, you're fighting Paul Blart, Mall Cop...right now.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Did I do any specific damage to the glass panel?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, yeah, you left a big crack in it. You didn't get all the way into it, and there doesn't seem to be any kind of like-- soul juice leaking out of it, but you did crack it.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Great.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Next in the order is Maarvey, who says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know what? Let's actually see if we can't start-- right-- let's see if we can't-- let me get my pen out and dip it in the old inkwell and start writing down something in my book--	Maarvey
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			Magnus: [exaggerated snoring noises]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I'm doing my best out here!	Maarvey
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			Magnus: [exaggerated snoring noises continue]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He rears back one of his giant fists, this fist is like the size of your torso-- his frame like I said is like heavily armored, very tank-like, he's got these two sort of small bent legs that-- is not really holding up his frame as much as his two arms with these two giant fists at the end of them, is. And he doesn't seem to have any kind of like, discernable head. His fuse is just right in the middle of his body, and it is now cracked.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But anyway he rears back one of these gigant-- ginormo fists- [crosstalk]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I duck.	Travis

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	He casts Dispel Magic on his friend Taako to try to get rid of this Confusion that he has.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And with Dispel Magic, you choose one creature, he is a creature, so he -- chooses him--	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I doubt that's how he prefers to be referred to, is as a creature-- unless that was his nickname in college.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It's him, it's Taako.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.	Clint

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You did not... you didn't end shit, you didn't dispel shit from shit.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	I-- how about a little, can I take the edge off of it, maybe?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Maybe he's a little less confused, maybe?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No. He's still very-- he's still like, really super duper duper confused.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	If anything, he's more confused because he just saw you waggle your fingers at him a bunch, and nothing happened.	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Justin and Clint laugh]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And literally nothing happened.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Highly confusing.	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hellooooo!	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	We do need to resolve the fact that Taako, when you were Confused, the spell you were channeling to summon Garyl ended, and he vanished underneath Magnus.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Which would've been hilarious if we had thought of it at the time.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			But--	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	We need to reward our initiatives. That's okay.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Carey.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Carey reaches into her pocket and pulls out what looks like a little white pebble that she throws upwards into the air, and it starts emitting this flashing light, and it kind of like hangs in the air emitting this strobe light. And your eyes are kind of like naturally drawn to it, and so are your robotic opponents.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And when your eyes kind of adjust as this thing stops blinking and these robots are still kind of looking up at it, you see Carey almost like hanging in midair with her arms outstretched with two daggers, one dagger in each hand, which she brings down in a cross-chop on Maarvey's back.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Wow.)	And  (Clint

MECHANICS		NO	Next in the order is Taako.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Do I need to start off rolling a d10?	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Yes, you do.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	8.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, with an 8, you are going to use your action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there's no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Cool.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So within your reach, let me think.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	Magnus just rushed up...	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I think it would only be Merle, is the only thing that would be nearby you.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well yeah, melee, not– not Taako's strong suit.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	All
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Merle, I imagine you'd be very confused and upset by this?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[glum] No, I'm used to it.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[big laugh] "I deserve this."	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You're saying, Taako just like freaking out in combat and attacking you elicits no response except for "Meh..." Just sort of a begrudging sort of acceptance?	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Well, yeah, I knew he was--	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It makes sense that-- he assumes it's my retribution for him not successfully removing my Confusion.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, I knew he was Confused.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's quite the heel turn there, Taako!	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
NON-CONTENT			I mean he...	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It is fair to say he did know I was confused somehow, so I mean, he would just chalk it up to confusion and not me personally.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That is fair.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Next in the order is Magic Brian, who says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I've been working on my Magic Missile for a while, would you like to see it?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you left off the word "Merle" at the end of that statement.	Merle

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he casts Fireball.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, a twenty-foot radius sphere. So he's gonna kinda point it at the ground in between all three of you.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	So all of you need to make a dexterity saving throw, and I'm gonna say Magnus, you're gonna have disadvantage on this since you are prone.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Griffin. Good DMing.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] Okay, okay, well, that's another critical miss!	Travis

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So Magic Brian literally like lifts up his cannon arm and grabs his wrist and fuckin' cocks it, and then fires this gigantic burst of flame at the three of you. Taako, you dodge out of the way, and Magic Brian seems very impressed by that, but yeah, Magnus, you particularly just catch this one real bad.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Jenkins looks at how bad off Maarvey is and casts Stoneskin.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Let me tell you what Stoneskin does, because I know you're wondering. It's like a-- so let me explain. In this game, clerics can cast buffs on the other members of their party, to like, make 'em more survivable, and keep 'em from getting hurt and taking damage or making them more-- it's like a really good thing that clerics can do.

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I don't think he's paying attention.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	--as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. So, all physical attacks, Maarvey has resistance to. Next in the order is Magnus.	Griffin

NON-CONTENT			Yeah, you, uh, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, I'm gonna say, he just channeled Fireball through that arm, and I don't think you're gonna be able to cast another Fireball out of it, but there is definitely like, this arm is still hot to the touch, and there seems to be like-- you know how like when people use a flamethrower, and when they use it, there's still that little spout of flame that comes out after they're done? Done blasting off--?	Griffin

MECHANICS		YES	What's Faerie Fire?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That doesn't seem like a thing that you... yeah, that's like a beautiful light made of fairy magic.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	6. 1. 10. 17 points of damage.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You put this thing right up against the fuse in the middle of Magic Brian's chest, you fuckin' cock it and uh, release all of the leftover fire magic in his arm and you just blast the thing in the middle of his chest, and it does a ton of damage to him, and his-- that glass fuse kind of shatters, and the white sort of floating light that was inside of it pops out, and is now floating in between the two other robots.

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing.	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	Up to six creatures of my choice that I can see within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 plus my spellcasting modifier, and since I'm using my last number 4 spell slot, if you're using a spell slot of third level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

NON-GAME_RELATED			And I'll, maybe I'll edit that to make it so that they both happened at the same time. Or I can use my, like, I've been studying Malaysian throat singing. It's this cool new technique. All the kids are talking about it.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a question for you, my dear new friend. I'm ready to let bygones be bygones, just answer this one question for me, sweaze? Sweaze? [Taako: Sure.] That's French for please. [Taako: Mh-hm.] Would you like the fish, or the beef?	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			At the wedding, you mean.	Taako

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm a vegetarian, actually, so... do you have a third option, or...?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I um... no. Well, we'll have some sides, some hearty sides, and of course some sweet bread rolls. But I'll send you a link to my registry later. I asked, I had a toaster on that registry, but I no longer think that that will be necessary.	Magic Brian

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh shit! Oh god!	Maarvey
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, this is especially effective on the gorilla robot, because like I said, he was sort of, all of his center of gravity was based up on his fists, and now that he does not- no longer have that, he is like kicking and flailing like a little baby up there.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	That is a twenty.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Welcome back, Travis!	Clint
MECHANICS		NO	You actually have advantage on that roll since you're actively in a fight with this thing, but you cleared the save, so-- Spoiler alert, they added that caveat because Dominate Person is bad, bad stuff. It's your turn now, Mag.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Remind me, what's the Stoneskin?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Stoneskin is, they have resistance to melee damage. In addition to that he also has Haste, so he has +2 to AC, advantage on Dex saving throws and an extra action on his turn.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I wanna smash 'em together!	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	What did you roll?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	The attack was a 15 + 7 because that's my combat- my attack bonus, so 22.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, that ties with the buff, with the big guys, so you'll do damage to both of them. Just roll one d10 plus your modifier.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled an 8, let's say that my damage modifier is a +4.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, you throw the wiry bot that held Jenkins and Magic Brian into the big ol' gorilla bot that held Maarvey, and as they collide, the wire bot takes all that damage. The Maarvey-bot does not because it has the Stoneskin, it takes half that damage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you see the fuse inside of the little wiry bot shatter and explode, and two balls of light fly out of it, and fly into the big gorilla-bot. So now all thr-- you see these three fuses-- you see these three lights inside of the fuse of the big gorilla Maarvey bot and you can't really distinguish between them anymore, it's just like glowing very very very brightly, and you hear just sort of the three of them fighting amongst themselves.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Why?	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	I would argue, wouldn't the gorilla bot take another hit, colliding with the wall?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The Jenkins bot, robot is like… pretty li’l, it's about shoebox size, so I don't think it would have enough force. It was the tiniest of the three robots so I don't think it would have enough force to, like, do that kind of wrecking-ball damage to him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But sort of the force of it hitting it did enough, but not enough to move it backwards-- so now all--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	But the good news is, I get a second attack, (Griffin: Yeah, and now all--) --and I'm gonna punch the shit out of that gorilla bot.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			M’kay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	You're just gonna punch it?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I'm gonna Phantom Fist the fuck out of it.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			[laughing] Okay.	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	That is a... 14+7, 21, does that hit?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	It does not. No, it doesn't hit his Stoneskin AC.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Would you say it still pushed it, though, because it is floating.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you push it a little bit, but not enough to like kill it.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, bummer.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			All right.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Maarvey is going to take a swipe at you, Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He's floating--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I duck.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wow, that was easy.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, he is going to have disadvantage because he doesn’t– he can't like, put his feet on the ground and turn into it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That would be a hit... [dice] that probably isn't... 16?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Nope!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Nope, all right, yeah, you block his blow with a shield.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Riposte! If attack missed, attack plus the superiority die.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	That is a-- [mutters]16, plus 7- 23?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yes, that is a hit.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Excellent, and then, it's just a standard melee attack, so we'll say, one-handed Railsplitter... [dice] [mutters numbers, leading to:] so 10 points of damage.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, it does not do very much, again, because of his Stoneskin, but it is enough to make Maarvey-bot give up the ghost, quite literally, as the fuse in his chest explodes and the three ghosts come flying out of him. And Magic Brian says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, good going, Maarvey! You really proved yourself there, Arnold! Good going, strong man!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I did my best, okay? I'm a dead guy inside of a robot, I'm new, I'm learning my body, I'm going through robot puberty, I'm learning all kinds of stuff about myself-- Are you there God, it's me Maarvey! I don't know how my robot body works.	Maarvey
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Jenkins says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boy, you guys are just absolutely hopeless. I'm going to go find another robot to get inside.	Jenkins
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh yeah, they can do that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Carey shouts at you, Merle, but like, whispered--	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, can't you like, do some cleric stuff? Can't you like, channel the divinity or banish them or something?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hm! Yes, I can! I cast Turn Undead... and destroy the undead.	Merle
MECHANICS		NO	Okay, they get to roll a Wisdom saving throw.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Maarvey-- rolled a critical miss-- and evaporates. Jenkins rolled a 7 and evaporates. And Magic Brian-- holy shit-- Magic Brian also does not clear it, Jesus, the three of them just kind of turn into beautiful particles, the white light just sort of starts to fade away.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	What? Wait a minute! [hyperventilating] What?	Clint
NON-CONTENT			You, uh, yeah--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You were successful. You did it.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	What?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You shout a command word from the divine Extreme Teen Bible of Pan, and that command word was...?	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boogity boogity!	Merle
NON-CONTENT			All right.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Magic Brian says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What? What is he saying, what is the boogity-- [screams]	Magic Brian
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And they start to disintegrate and Jenkins says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again.	Jenkins
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Travis laughs.]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Hey Griffin, when you say they evaporate, do they go back to like heaven or hell or the after-plane or whatever, or are they gone?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Kind of seems like you just obliterated their soul. Kind of seems like you just kind of erased 'em.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Man, you know, at the end of the day, I punch people, but Dad unmakes their existence! Who's the real monster?	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint wheeze-laughs.]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, I guess Griffin 'cause he told Dad to do it.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's fair. Griffin's a monster-maker.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You've taught me a lesson, I've learned the lesson.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He taught you to kill!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, [strongly] to obliterate.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	To obliterate, yeah.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Dad unmade an existence. Three!	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	So what's up with [crosstalk] --They got any gold?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	[laughing, snorting] What's the loot? What's the fat loot?	Travis
MECHANICS		YES	Do we need to roll Need?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Check the loot table.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I roll Need.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	See if their very existence left behind any gold.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Maybe some kind of like, power from like, unmaking a human.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You strip some copper wire out of the wiry robot, and you think you can sell that for some fuckin' meth money, baby.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You do have Magic Brian's blaster arm, still. Which-- it seems dormant now, but you can still feel a bit of magical energy still coursing through it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I hand it to Taako.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I don't have any use for this magic shit.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thanks.	Taako
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I could use a spare arm.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You earn that spare arm and you'll get it!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Uh, I'm the guy that just obliterated three dudes?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You're not-- you're not Mr. Potatohead, you can't just swap your arms out interchangeably...	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	No, not till you reach level 8.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	He is level 8!	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Oh!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Let's have a fucking arm party!	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I went to an arm party once, trust me, you don't... you don't wanna...	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You take your arm off, you throw it in a bowl… [trails off, muttering]	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Can we celebrate my victory?	Clint
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[victory music]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Why?	Clint
NON-CONTENT			?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Griffin, can you do the-- tell Dad he solved your whatever puzzle?	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, you solved your-- you solved my 'doing a thing that you learned to do at your class level 2' puzzle.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Yes!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You solved my 'thing you've been able to do for literally over a year now' puzzle.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And I did it by completely obliterating three of the most beloved NPCs we've ever had on the show!	Clint
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughs]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Hey, maybe they'll come back, there's always a possib-- no, they're done.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No. They're gone.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Let's move forward down the pipe where we were going on the conveyor belt.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay, yeah, you--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	When we got stopped by these nerds.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah… [stammers]	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Also, Carey's been really quiet, could Carey say something like, great job, guys!	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Yeah, is she kind of stunned by my obliterations?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, she's actually pretty blown away, she's like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wow, Merle, I didn't know you had that in you! That was some savage shit!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah! I didn't either!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… I did kill all three of them.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No you didn't!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no, Magnus, you did a great job too, I mean, I definitely--	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I destroyed the robit bodies.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I definitely loosened the lid of that there pickle jar, but let's-- you know what? Let's split the-- we'll split it four ways, we all did-- Oh, sorry, five-- five ways, Noelle, sorry...	Carey
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Noelle, actually, is being extremely quiet. Noelle hasn't actually said anything this whole time since the three ghost robots showed up. And she is just kinda floating sullenly [Travis: Oh, wait a minute…] away from you down the tunnel with her flashlight on.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pst! Guys! Noelle's a spirit in a robot body!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ohhhhh man.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She's got the fuse! She's gotta be real bummed out about this news!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, go talk to her.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C'mon, guys, we gotta move on, we're almost- we’re almost there.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle... [Noelle: Yeah?] I recognize now that you are a spirit, in a fuse, in a robot body, but I want you to know that I appreciate you as a member of this team, you've helped us a lot--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] I can't-- I don't-- I don't know what you-- I really don't know what you're talking about.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, whenever you're ready.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, holistically speaking, you've gone from being a sentient AI to being a soul trapped in a machine... I think it's a zero-sum game, [Magnus: Yeah] you didn't have any illusions about your own agency, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is this like, funny? Is this, like–[Magnus: No!] are you joking about this?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What? No, I'm not joking, I mean, I, I mean, you thought you were a robot before, right? [heavy silence] ...Oh, no.	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says, um... [trails off]	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, gosh. Okay. Someone's really stepped in the old spectral doo-doo now, eh? Um hm...	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I-- I did-- I did-- I died. [“Hogsbottom” starts to play] Oh my God, I'm remembering now. I--I-- my name is Noelle Redcheek. My family runs a cider press out in- out in Hogsbottom. I was ridin' our donkey into town and I was making a delivery to some dive bar, the… it was The Sleeping Giant. And it was in town, in Phandalin. And we heard--	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Never heard of it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we heard screams from outside and there was this man, he came downstairs, he called himself- called himself Bluejeans. [Magnus gasps] And he was so kind, he told us to hide in the stockroom and he-- he-- he hid us and he fought off this dwarf that was on fire, and he got him out of the bar and we thought we were safe. And then the whole world got burned up.	Noelle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk as the characters react]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sucks. That is bad news.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. Woof. Woof. Whoo. Hate to hear that, you know. I’m so sorry.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah, too bad.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm so sorry.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But what matters now is that you're technically alive.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, no, not technically...	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, literally, technically. She, you're in a techno body so you're technically alive.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She actually starts laughing.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh good.	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Hogsbottom fades out]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She's like, [laughs awkwardly]	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm sorry, I just remembered, I was in that back room and everything was getting burned up, and I remember my last thought was that the whole world was getting destroyed. And the fact that I'm here, and y'all are still here... I thought the world was ending, I thought my whole family was gone, but the world's still here, right? It's still here!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Phandalin not so much...	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let's parse the question. Was your family in Phandalin?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, they're out in Hogsbottom.	Noelle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk as the characters react with relief, "Yeah, you're good," "They're okay then," etc.]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do y'all know what happened to Phandalin?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, no... I heard-- you just said that it burned? You said that, right? That was you? Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, yeah.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[choosing words carefully] We are part of the people that try to keep things like what happened in Phandalin from happening. [Merle: Yeah, yeah, yeah.] We have... a pretty good success rate, if you don't count that one, which, we can all agree, was a world-class boner. [Clint laughing] Now, if you want to keep what happened to you from happening to other people, it is imperative that you aid us down here in completing our mission.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In this. In this thing now.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're saying that this thing that's turning this lab to crystal is trying to do to the world like what happened in Phandalin?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can save the world, Noelle.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All right then. Let's fuck 'em up.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Heeeell yeah.	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The fuse pops out of her chest. Pops out of the bot.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it seems to be floating in midair, not like smoothly-- it's almost like the spirit inside it is pushing up on it, like, imagine a bird sort of like moving its birdcage just by flying really hard into the top of it. This is like an extreme amount of effort that this soul is using to push its fuse upward into the air. And you see it move its way over into the pile of parts that you left on the floor that were the robots whose asses you just kicked.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she floats into the big gorilla suit's body [Clint: Oh, yeah.]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	and you see that mech, you see that robot stand up and pick up the wires and sort of tie it around its back and you see it pick up one of the arms left over from Magic Brian's robot, and strap that onto itself, and take some of the plating off that one, and take some of the plating off the old Noelle bot--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I throw the Buster arm and say,	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Take-- Let's go to fuck-up town!	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a fucking port open on this robot's side that catches that Buster arm in mid-air.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And these four robots combine fuckin' Voltron style with Noelle in the middle of it. And she says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hero time.	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	--and cocks her gun arm.	Griffin
