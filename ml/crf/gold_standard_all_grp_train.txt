Ummm, only it is… uh, as Lucas suggested, covered in pink crystal. Um, and there’s kind of a gnarly winter storm happening outside? And so there are these, like-	Griffin

Um, there’s no, y’know, lush field of grass. Uh, it’s all just one sort of enclosed space.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now, we’ve had to… um… get kind of creative with your approach? Uh, we- we can’t have you connected in any way because… if say, for instance if you rappel down if the rope touches the crystal it could travel up here-	The Director
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mmhmm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-and we could lose the base. Um, so we’ve cast a- a levitation charm on both of these gondolas, and we’re kinda gonna need to… just sorta… hurl you down there.	The Director

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you holler that into the abyss, you are pushed off of the- the Bureau of Balance hangar, and it's a bit terrifying? Because now you're kind of freefalling? Kind of sinking slowly? Kind of floating? Diagonally directly towards the laboratory. And your- your movin- your target is this hole towards the top of the- the base- the skylight in the conservatory that Lucas mentioned in last week's episode that you probably forgot about.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But suddenly a squall from this winter storm presses up against your boat, and your boat starts a-rockin' and a-rollin' in the- in the sky.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And so does the Regulators' boat, you actually see them get a little bit more altitude, like this storm is like picking them up a little bit, sorta throwing off Avi's trajectory. And as you approach the base, they've actually gained a lot of altitude.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you watch their gondola just kind of sail over this- this- [Clint starts laughing] this craggy sort of crystalline mountain range that has sort of built up as the snow collects on top of the base.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you watch them sort of disappear out of sight, while your own boat gets rocked around a little bit, but the trajectory doesn't get off too much, and you guys skid to a halt on top of the- on top of this lab's dome, kind of precariously teetering over the edge of this hole into the conservatory below.	Griffin

NON-CONTENT			Aw, man.	Travis

It's got these long legs that end in- almost in points? It doesn't appear to have traditional feet, it seems to be just sort of suspended in the air somehow… it seems to be just sort of suspended in the air somehow. And its torso is comprised of a large single piece of tourmaline that's about as broad and tall as a refrigerator with these nasty looking spurs poking out of it. Its head is these- more of these crystal blades coming together to form like a pyramid-like peak. And that light has risen out of the pond you're standing on and is now spread throughout this entire… crystal golem, making it appear like his insides are all just white fire. And uh, it's pretty- it looks pretty menacing.	Griffin

NON-CONTENT			Uh, okay.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Are you okay with that? Magnus?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know if you saw, I hit him and did, like, six damage. That is not something I am used to.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, you good with running?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--I think that this- you’re a bunch of honeys!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think this is the first time we’ve faced anything that was actually tough--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--that we weren’t assured of beating--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			--and you’re gonna run away.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know that if we--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wah, wah, wah! Run away!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You known that if we all die, there’s no more podcast and we don’t get the money from the MaxFun donations anymore, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Run! [Griffin laughs] Run away! Run away!	Merle
NON-CONTENT			Uh, okay, uh, the--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Griffin, wait, wait, wait. Before we do this, is this not what we’re supposed to do? Because it really felt to me like we were supposed to run away.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			There’s no--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	This is alright, this is our adventure.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah, there’s no, like--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, I wanna win DnD.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Yeah, sure.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Don’t chop off the--don’t chop off the kimono.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Um…	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I ripped open the kimono, whether you like it or not.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, okay, we’ll say you guys are--start moving away from this big crystal golem, and we’ll use Magnus’s turn as sort of the basis of that group action. Um, and on the start of this crystal golem’s turn, he watches-- which--where are you running?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Um, remind me the options?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Back to where you dropped in, or that white circle of light around the metal hatch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	White circle of light, please.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, let’s go for it.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Are we ever gonna know why he pointed at Merle and said, “You”?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, ‘cause you just have one of those faces, you know--	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	One of those faces.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	--that people see and they’re like, “Ooh, that guy.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Mm-mm.”	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, the three of you make a break for that white hatch.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Um, and on its turn…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Wait a minute, can we please at least go [wooping, imitating Zoidberg from Futurama] “wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub”?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yes, I will assume that that is what you--the sound that you created as you did that. And, uh, as you bolt, on this crystal golem’s turn, Della Reese is gonna get [a gasp, as if they forgot that Della Reese was here], uh, a strike with her heavenly sword [pronounces the w in “sword”] on it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	And this thing… makes a dexterity saving throw. [Dice rolling] That’s a nine, so I doubt that’s gonna clear it.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So, yeah, Della Reese just stabs this thing right through its--	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	20 radiant damage.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	For, uh, for, yeah, it gets stabbed right through the ol’ chest.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Um, and it actually takes 40 radiant damage.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear it scream. Through that--that--that crystal beak, um, that it intimidated Merle with earlier. You hear it just, like, scream.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and the--the light in this thing, uh, kind of pops out of its chest and leaves that crystal golem, and the golem just falls to the ground.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I knew we could do it!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Way to go, Della!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And a rift, uh, opens up back in--in--in space, and the light flies into it and disappears.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I never doubted us for a second.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I knew we could win.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Della Reese… Della Reese looks at you and says… “Looks like someone just got touched by an angel.” Then she- she sheathes her sword and disappears.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, that’s pretty good.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wow. That was an excellent adventure.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	What kind of loot do we get?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I mean, there’s a bunch of, uh, you know, virulent crystal all--basically everywhere.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Fuck yeah, finally some crystal.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	This place is probably worth about, like, 20 trillion gold pieces. Just, like, in total.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Just, like, if you take--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I still wanna make our way to that glowing hatch thing.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, I’d like to go check that out too.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Okay, yeah, it is a circular hatch with a gap in between these two semicircle doors, um, and there is a--a--there’s a--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, wait.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Huh?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Merle.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Huh?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s why it was you, ‘cause you’re the holy man. Because you have some kind of religious thing, radiant did double damage.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Ohh.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s why he singled you out.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[laughs] Let’s remember that.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, so you-- this hatch has a small panel on the door of it, and it is not crystallized, and you hear, actually, Lucas come in through the pendant that the Director gave you before you, uh, departed from the Bureau of Balance headquarters. You hear Lucas say:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			First of all, what the hell was that? What just happened? I heard a bunch of, like, crumbling and cracking and tink--crinkle- tinkles.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, it was us. We, uh, there was a crystal monster, and we lured him into a trap that we had set.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We pretended we were running away.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Pretended we were running away.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he fell for it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He fell for it. Dingus.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then we killed it.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, we trapped-- sort of, yeah. We killed it. Yeah, we did.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, we did.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			20 experience points.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We gave ourselves 25 crystal experience points. [Griffin laughing]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, that shouldn’t--there shouldn’t be anything here. Anything that was in the crystallized rooms should’ve just gotten-- just should’ve gotten frozen. I don’t underst--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, you weren’t here, were you? You weren’t here.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Lucas.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus here. In your experiments with these crystals, did you ever hear a voice or sounds like something was talking to you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ummm, no. I don’t-- I don’t know what you’re talking about.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, okay. All right. I don’t believe you, but--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It didn’t happen to us, either. Noooo.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-uh.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope. Nope.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay. Have you made it to the-- to the exit of the conservatory, to the first arcane airlock?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it the glowing hatch?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s what it would look like. Yeah, sure.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Then yes.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hell yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yeah. Just put your hand on the panel, and I’ll channel enough energy into it and let you guys through, and then once you move through that chamber, I’ll be able to shut down that airlock and buy us a little bit more energy and a little bit more time.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I do that.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			‘Kay, um--	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, is this gonna affect how the reclaimers-- all their shit and being able to get in and stuff?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I thought we were the only reclaimers.	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Are you saying that into the pendant?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, I’ve got my hand over the pendant.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Talking to Merle and what’s-his-face.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I forgot who they are and what they’re doing.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t care about them anyway.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The regulators, the ones who are, like, supposed to back us up and, like, arrest--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, they’re doing a great job so far, aren’t they?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Where are they?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They got blown away in the gnarly storm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh man, like The Martian. Love that book. Listen, okay? We’re done here.	Taako
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[laughs] That’s a good conversation, guys.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think that we’ve already proven that we can’t keep really good track of them, just from, like, a narrative-- human being-- like, I don’t think we can keep tabs on ‘em. They’ve got-- really gotta fend for themselves, ‘cause we need the time.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You know what? I can’t fault your logic.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	All right, I uncover the pendant. I put my hand on the thing.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s what I’m saying. Either they die--	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, I re-cover the pendant.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Either they die, or we forget them. Either way, they’re not going to--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Probably both.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, probably both.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[muffled] Hey, guys, did you go through the door yet?	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I un-cover the pendant.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, thank god. It was getting a little stuffy in-- wait, that doesn’t make sense.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, that’s not how that works. [someone laughs] Are you in the pendant?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you live in the pendant?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He is independent.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, that’s a good joke. Anyway, just put your hand on the panel on the door and it should open up for you, and-- and, um, you’ll-- you’ll-- you’ll be protected, um, from the, uh, from that crystal thing. You should be-- the next chamber should be clear as far as I know.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Cool, I do that.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Uh, okay.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Hold on, Merle-- Magnus--	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, that’s okay.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	God-- son of a dammit. Could you two not have gotten together on the letters with which your names begin?	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Should I be Perle?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Mine actually has a silent P.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So, shit, then you’re Perle and Pagnus. You guys really are the worst two people.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			[Clint cackles] Um--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	What were you gonna say, Taako?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Dad was gonna say something.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I’m just calling him Dad.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s my dad.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Dad, what were you gonna say?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He was gonna say something.	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I’m in character, so I don’t answer.	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Holy shit.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Fuck me running.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, Merlgnus is gonna say something now.	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just was wondering if it might be a trap, but--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re obviously in a hurry to get through the airlock.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope, not a trap.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Eat me, we don’t know you!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re a real– you’re a dingbat, too. I don’t like you at all, but let’s go. I say we get through. This is getting boring, and this is a podcast. Let’s go.	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You move into the airlock, and it’s like, uh, it’s like an airlock in a spaceship or a submarine.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s a small chamb--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Which we have all been in.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	Um, no.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, maybe?	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Probably--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Maybe in the backstory.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Probably not.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s just a little chamber, and it has two of these white circular hatches on either side, and as you move into the airlock, it is not crystallized.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It is--it’s made of just sort of a white metal, and, um, uh, the hatch closes behind you, and you hear a hissing sound.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			There’s some, uh--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Snakes!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Some smoke in the room, and then the chamber’s full of snakes, and you drown in snakes. You drown in snakes.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Not again.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	Uh, no, there’s no snakes.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Just a little bit of smoke, and then the smoke clears and you hear, like, a bing-bong noise.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Maybe I’ll put that in in post, maybe I won’t.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Um, and--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wait, wait, wait, you said smoke, and bong. Cheech and Chong are in there.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Hell yeah.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			I thought you were doing--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And they’re covered in snakes!	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Griffin laughs]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And Cheech is a snake, and so is Chong. They’re both snakes.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s all snakes. It’s snakes all the way down.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Soup to nuts, snakes, snakes, snakes.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Man, I hope when J.J. Abrams remakes this podcast, he takes all this stuff out.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			“What we decided to do, guys, is just lose a lot of the snake stuff. We know the fans love it, but we’re worried that it wouldn’t be as approachable material ‘cause, uh, it’s real heavily laden with snakes. I didn’t really underst--it becomes hard to follow because--”	Justin (imitating Abrams yet sounding like a Muppet)
NON-GAME_RELATED			Is J.J. Abrams a puppet?	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			“Our heroes become snakes, and, uh, they are all married to snakes, and they use snakes as weapons.”	Justin (still imitating Abrams)
NON-GAME_RELATED			Hand me some of that macaroni and cheese with snakes on it.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Snakes in their blood that lets them do magic.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			“They eat snakes for fuel, and they become snake robots for a while. It’s very confusing, got rid of most of the snakes. There’s still a lot of snakes, but, I mean, there’s just a regular amount of snakes for The Adventure Zone, which, for any other thing, is still an enormous amount of snakes.”	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
NON-CONTENT			So, uh…	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			“And lens flare! [more laughter] That’s the two big things.”	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So, uh, on the other end of this airlock, is more snakes.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Uh--	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint loses it laughing]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh no!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I knew it!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	On the other end of this airlock, it--actually, I know I said there was a hatch, a hatch, on the other side. There’s actually two hatches. It, uh, it branches off, forming sort of a Y junction. Um, and hanging in between those two hatches is, a, uh, a sign, and it is noting which is in either direction. And you hear Lucas say:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now you should be at a--a--a branch in the path, um, and-- and I’ll be able to buy us a little bit more time. We’re at about-- oh, we’re running real low, guys. We’re at about ten minutes before this thing h-hits the water, um, so whichever one you go in, I’ll be able to disable the airlock on the other side and-and buy us a bit more time by giving me more energy to channel, uh, into the core. Um, so--so pick a side, and I’ll just, uh, I’ll--after you go through, I’ll shut down the other one.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What are the two sides?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, to the left, you see a sign over the hatch that says, “Research Materials Storage Chamber,” and then, on the right, you see a sign that says, “The Magical World of Elevators.”	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Faint laughter from Justin]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Really?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Griffin--	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That’s what it says.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Griffin’s really sticking it to the people who say he’s not allowed to have elevators in this game.	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint cackles]	stage
NON-CONTENT			Um--	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Again, it’s the Research Materials Storage Chamber, or the Magical World of Elevators.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This one’s easy. It’s elevators. Let’s go.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here we go!	Merle
NON-CONTENT			Uh, okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You walk forward and open up this next hatch, and it spins open to… a beautiful, ornate room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, a fairly large chamber that almost sort of resembles, like, a museum with these different exhibits lining both sides of this long chamber. And inside of each exhibit, in little brass and wood display cases, you see different elevators. Um, and you hear Lucas chime in and say, like:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you made it to The Magical World of Elevators, huh?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus, Merle, & Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s, uh--well, this lab has been in my family for a few generations. I--I inherited it from my--from my mom, um, but there was a codicil in the will that required that I keep this museum, uh, honoring my grandpa’s greatest technological accomplishment, intact. He--he invented the elevator. And honestly, like, most of the technological, uh, advancements in our world. That was all--that was all Grandpa Roman. So, um, yeah, I couldn’t change it, but go ahead and have a look around. It’s--I think you might learn a little bit of something about elevators.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t we have, like, shit to do?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it hard feeling like you’re always in his shadow? Does it--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ooh, good question.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you feel like you’re in Roman’s shadow?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, a little bit, sometimes, like--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m trying to make my own mark on the world, and frankly, I feel like a lot of his inventions were kind of primitive, and people just aren’t as excited about inventions. Like, when the first elevator came out, forget about it. But you try and invent a new, better elevator, and people don’t wanna hear any of it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s an up and down business.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			People say that about, um, Thomas Edison a lot. Like, he invented the lightbulb, but--right?--but, like, they didn’t have them back then, right? So if I had been around back then, that would have been easy for me, ‘cause they didn’t have lightbulbs. They didn’t have anything. So, like, inventing stuff was way easier. These days, I’d have to invent, like, a double lightbulb or something to even get that kind of impact.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Holy--just--wait--pau--hold on for a second. I gotta write that down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double light bulb.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can have that one, that’s fine.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Light bulb…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, don’t give it to him!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, money's no object to me.	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			Merle: [groans]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That is patently untrue. That’s not in character. I’m just telling you that’s-- I’m calling horseshit on that on behalf of our listening audience.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, no, no, no, no--	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s just a façade.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, no, no, the fact that money is patently important to Taako is patently untrue. That Taako would say that--	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	--is not.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay, fair.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And I think we learned a little bit about Lucas today.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I feel like we’ve really grown.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think we’ve all--let’s go home and think about what we’ve learned.	Magnus
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I gotta say, the timing on this episode’s a little bit off, ‘cause I think we’re at the end of it now, and, man, it would’ve been cool if it had ended with Della Reese stabbing a crystal monster to death and not the three of you entering a museum and then, like, having a talk with some guy about his grandpa.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, why don’t you re-cut that in here, Griffin?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Della Reese shows up and stabs through an elevator. She says, “Well, I got a taste for it now.”	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint laughs]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	“I just love killing.”	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[music starts to fade in]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And hates elevators.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	“Hi, I’m Della Reese and I love killing.”	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Looks like this elevator just got touched by an angel, right, guys?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	More like a Dellavator.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	This one’s going down!	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	So the three of you are, uh, after surviving a pretty thrilling Della Reese based climax and—	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Travis fake-laughs]	stage
NON-GAME_RELATED			Yeah that was a pretty troubling, [Griffin and Clint chuckle], troublesome sentence that I just said.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uhh, you find yourselves in the Magical World of Elevators, something of a museum dedicated to the elevator-based achievements of the Miller family.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Got it.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Uh, Griffin, before we go on I wanna do something I should’ve thought of last episode.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			 [amused] Is that, is that happening?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, [Justin snorts], D’Jangus. Um, what, what do you know about the Philosopher’s Stone? We just ran into like a crystal golem thing that like sang to us. And it was like—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that shouldn’t, that definitely shouldn’t happen. The Philosopher’s Stone is just a very powerful, um, sort of cypher for transmutation magic. And it allows you to change really any material into any other material, but it shouldn’t be able to animate material! Because I mean, that, that’s just beyond its capabilities!	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you know anything about like a crystalline demon? It was like a glowing ball of light, it sang, it was really creepy, it sounded like a vocoder.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How did it… How did it find you? Tell me everything.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, we were walking across a crystallized—	Magnus

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, yeah that was good editing.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, uh. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it was somehow inspirited by uh, by a ghost or something like that, but it, you said it came through some sort of rift? In spacetime?	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep, he did.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s not… ghosts can’t really do that. So I’m not a hundred percent sure what we’re up against here. Um, but I’ll start cracking the books and see what I can find out for you.	Angus

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So you’re in the Magical World of Elevators and there are uh— the room has these two rows, uh, that you can tell just looking at the elevators featured in each exhibit are sort of a chronological detail of how this particular invention that the Miller family brought to this world, um, sort of evolves.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Mmhmm...	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s a little plaque and a little description next to each one. The first one is kind of just a crude bucket with a thick rope that has a year, it says “1469 DR. Roman Miller.” Which you intuit to be Lucas Miller’s grandpa that you talked about last week.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, ‘cause we’re an intuitive bunch.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, clearly.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This does not look like the safest elevator in the world, it basically does just look like a bucket. It looks hundreds of years old, some cockroaches actually scurry away from that particular exhibit as you come close to it.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shut up, you guys, I’m saving my good rolls.	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So there’s a few more of Roman’s designs. There’s a one that looks like a bucket but the pulley looks like it’s gas-powered. Um, which looks pretty deadly.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	“Upsy, Your Lifting Friend.”	There’s one that has a face on it and the plaque says that it’s called
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint laughs]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s almost like a cartoonish elevator that was obviously made to like franchise. Like obviously when elevators came to this world it was a hot thing, cause you can imagine when elevators came to Earth it was probably really sick, like what, no more stairs?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s tight.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Where can I get one?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, so they tried obviously to do a theme park.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Y’know the day that elevators were invented, people just went around to stairs in their neighborhoods with ball-peen hammers just destroying, “Never again!”	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Won’t need these!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I step into that closet and I’m on a different floor!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I’ll never use these stupid stairs again!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	[laughs] And then on the other side of the room there’s a row of elevators that were actually designed by Lucas’s mother, whose name is Maureen.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they’re way better.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re so much better.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	They’re more conservative, I mean they were developed, you know, a generation after Roman’s lifting machines, is what he called them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, so they look like the more traditional elevators, a little bit less stylish, more functional. Somewhere down along the line of hers is “Upsy the Rad Lifting Dude” which is like a cool reboot of “Upsy Your Lifting Friend”. He has sunglasses on.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			…That, that elevator—	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint, Justin and Travis giggling in the background]	stage
NON-CONTENT			Are we t—? Are we—?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That elevator was a commercial failure. Based on every sense of the word.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Are we? To intuit from the name “Upsy” and the nomenclature of lifting machines. Like maybe they mastered like getting people up first and like didn’t have a plan for getting you back down?	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint laughs in the background]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s funny you mention that, actually, right next to “Upsy the Rad Lifting Dude” was his archnemesis in the cartoon and his name was “Downzo.”	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then at the end of the line is just an elevator. Uh, but on the far side of this room, kind of in front of the next airlock leading out of this chamber, you see something that looks unlike all of the other elevators in this room.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Um, it is—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Stairs.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	It, it looks like— it’s stairs, isn’t that crazy? No, it’s uh, it looks very, very, very futuristic. Like way too futuristic, it has like almost Tron neon outlines, uh, it looks like an elevator, but it is the most futuristic-looking elevator you’ve ever seen. And it’s sitting on top of a cylindrical glass display case, and when you look into that glass display case, it almost looks like there’s a miniature model of the town of Neverwinter inside of it.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Uh-huh.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And atop it is this hyper neo-futuristic elevator that is labelled as “The Elevator of Tomorrow.”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	To scale? Is it to scale with the rest of the town?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh, no, it’s gigantic. It’s like your size and it’s on top of the glass display case.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas chimes in through the pendant and says, uh:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh! Okay, so, um, I left that running in demo mode. That’s “The Elevator of Tomorrow” and it’s, it’s consuming like a lot of power. So if you can cycle through the demo, uh, I’ll be able to shut it down remotely and that should actually free up a lot of energy for me to channel back into the lab’s core and keep us floatin’ above the sea for a little bit longer.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What does the demo do? What is it?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, it’s a… I don’t wanna spoil the surprise.	Lucas

NON-CONTENT			‘Kay.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a pretty, uh, incredible sight, as the elevator of tomorrow doesn’t go down— I mean it does, but it doesn’t go down in space, it actually goes down in scale.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The elevator of tomorrow shrinks, way way way down, and uh, Merle and Magnus you don’t really feel anything too different, but Taako you watch as their now completely shrunk down elevator— very slowly descends into the glass display case.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Cut to inside the elevator [hums to the melody of The Girl from Ipanema]	Travis

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I could eat you!	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[The song “The Elevator of Tomorrow” begins to play as Griffin describes the scene]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The elevator, uh, comes to a stop and the doors open and all of a sudden this glass display version of the city of Neverwinter now looks pretty big to you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s not actual size, you guys are actually almost the size of some of the taller buildings in town, kind of a Godzilla thing going on. Um, but, uh, yeah it is a weird version of Neverwinter because it doesn’t look like the Neverwinter that you three have almost certainly visited at some point in your life. There’s some things about it that are a bit off. The buildings are much taller for one thing, they reach into the sky. There’s a, uh, there’s a—  there’s streetlights, they’re not like the gas torches that you might see in some of the more civilized towns in your world. They’re actual electric streetlights. And there are metal battlewagons, lots and lots and lots of them. And there’s a mobile in the sky, that uh, is carrying these different airships of different shapes and sizes and models that are circling this model version of Neverwinter. And it looks like an impossibly futuristic version of Neverwinter that you are now inside and as the doors open up, that three minute timer begins to count down.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, Lucas can you still hear us?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty cool, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, so, what’s the deal? Like can you tell us about it now?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, this is, this is my vision for Neverwinter and ideally any town. And, um—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So not really an elevator though, right? Like we didn’t really go up or— Like it’s not like, this didn’t get us to a different floor so it’s a pretty shitty elevator, really.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s all semantics don’t you think?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it was more of like The Shrink Machine Into a Version of Neverwinter of Tomorrow.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well you did go down technically speaking—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean yeah, but it didn’t really elevate us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Okay, but imagine, what if we could build a tower that could get smaller as you go up, so you can shrink in size and adjust your own size as you go up wouldn’t that be neat?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Outside the glass you guys can see Taako pretending to be Godzilla like stomping around. Like with little claws.	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Griffin and Clint laugh, Clint makes a groaning Godzilla noise.]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Taako, Taako as you look down as they step out of this elevator all tiny like, you probably do feel a sense of, uh, grandiosity, looming over them.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, absolutely it’s great. More than usual, which is considerable.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And I bet he’s HUGE to us!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Gigantic.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, he’s gigantic. Um, Taako, and actually, from your vantage point, you actually see something else on the outskirts of the town. The elevator is sort of positioned in the center, the Times Square of this, uh, of this, uh, display.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Uhh—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s a little statue of George M. Cohan.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Actually you see a cockroach, that is now scurrying over buildings and moving very, very quickly towards the two of them.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Damn it, Merle!	Magnus
NON-CONTENT			And then suddenly—	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m sorry! [sighs]	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	—this cockroach is over the two of you, on the side of a, on the side of a nearby building. Uh, and you hear it hiss and rear up revealing two dripping, green fangs.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uhh and it hisses at you nastily and then you hear like that sound effect that means you just ran into a random encounter in a Final Fantasy game.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And we’re off to the races.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	I, uh, I— the moment that I see that happening, I turn on my heels and sprint back into the pocket tent because I forgot my sandwich in there, and then I rush back to where I can see really good.	Justin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, yeah, if a kid put him in an oven we didn’t want him to, like, break immediately. He’s gonna be a pretty expensive toy, so the room has some stress testing capabilities, but just, like, don’t go poking around into the walls and you’ll be fine. Um, if you can actually run through his program, you’ll be able to shut him down and I’ll be able to remotely turn that room off. So, get to work!	Lucas

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How do I shut you off?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I am powered by Lucas’ laboratory and its core power unit. [someone snorts] Only by shutting down the core power unit will I cease to function. This has not been a very exciting round of Stump Hodgepodge.	Hodgepodge
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I ask another question?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes, Magnus, just because I am feeling a little bit bored.	Hodgepodge

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	The one that’s left.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you find yourself in a slightly larger circular room than the Hodgepodge R&D chamber. There are a few points of interest in this room. There’s a big pillar in the middle of the room. There is some hanging ventilation system overhead, and there’s a grate that has been busted out of the bottom of one of these - this vent system. And the grate is now laying on the floor, so somebody clearly busted that out. And there’s a note on the pillar, that looks like it was pretty quickly scrawled out, that says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Crashed into ventilation system. Going on ahead. Meet you at elevators. -K	Note
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Cool.	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I thought everything was crystallized.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[sighs] No.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The crystallization hasn’t really spread all the way throughout the lab?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s why we’ve been shutting the archaic airlocks or whatever behind us.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Riiiiiight.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As you approach this center pillar, you see some movement come from behind it. And you hear a voice say,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hello?	Voice
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hello…	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And a robot about the size and shape of a car engine floats out from behind the pillar. And instead of immediately setting you on fire, or asking you riddles-	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[interrupting] You keep using that exact reference point for this call. We are super plugged in to how big a car engine is.	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[wheezing laughter]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Real gearheads, we are.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay, well, how else would you describe something car-engine sized?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I don’t know, I don’t know how big a car engine is!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I don’t know how big a car engine is! Microwave size? Refrigerator size? Bread box?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Make as big a hug shape with your arms as you can? That’s the size of this thing.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, okay.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It has a sign saying “Please Don’t Hug.”	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint laughing]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s covered in poisonous barbs. No, it-it looks like it was just “scrumbled” together with leftover parts from other robots, uh-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I hastily hide the arm in my pocket.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah, that’s…	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I quickly look up the word “scrumbled.”	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Justin said that in a Monster Factory, and I can’t - I, I’ve started using it as though it were an actual word.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I’m the Lewis Carroll of my generation.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Absolutely.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This robot, its core actually does look like a floating car engine, which I have written down here, now knowing that you have no fuckin’ clue what I’m talking about. It’s just a big, heavy block of metal. Imagine - if you’re - to give you a more robot-centric point of reference, more Conky-shaped than an Alan Tudyk-bot from “I, Robot.”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Does it have arms, legs?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It does! And again, it looks like it was made out of parts from other robots. So it has this big, hulkin’ central core with these vents and ports that don’t actually look like they’re in use. One of its arms looks vaguely...humanoid-shaped, like it’s got five fingers and a hand, but the metal doesn’t actually match the rest of the metal of its frame? It looks like it’s cast from bronze. The other arm is like a foot longer than the humanoid-esque arm, but it doesn’t have a hand at the end of it, it just kinda has a hole at the end of it. And it’s got these four small turbines that are giving off a faint blue light that are somehow keeping this thing levitating a few feet off the ground. It does not have legs, it’s just kinda floating through the air. And there’s a window in the center of its central frame, and inside - through that window, you can see what appears to be a pretty large glass cylindrical fuse, which illuminates whenever this thing talks!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[vaguely Southern accent] Are you in need of assistance?	Robot
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hail and well met, mechanical man!	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			“Ohhhhhhhh, very nice!”	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[music starts to play: A Far Friendlier Robot]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeeesss.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			“Is that a three-sixty cam-turner in the middle?”	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’ll go in the rumpus room, right there!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s gonna look real good on some red oak!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle floats towards you, Merle, and a cavity opens up, a little hatch opens on her central frame and a syringe pops out of it, and the syringe is full of a green fluid. And she starts to float in your direction with this syringe.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now hold real still--	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it laundry detergent?	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, it’s not.	Noelle

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry, it’ll take me a little bit to synthesize more of this first-aid fluid-	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We d-, I don’t need any more. Screw these guys.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle, pleasure to meet you, um-	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s real nice to meet you too, hey, what are the three of y’all doin’ here?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re looking for Lucas.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas is in towards the center of the lab, but y’all can’t get over there, it’s been crystallized? And I’ve seen what happens if you touch the crystal, you get turned into crystal! And so it’s pretty unsafe for y’all to be goin’ around.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’ve got these suits.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[simultaneously] We have these suits, yeah, the suits keep us that from happening to us. So we’re fine on that front.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you guys have those - y’all have null suits. Yeah, of course. So I guess you’d be okay to go in and try and find him.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Have you seen some other people come through here looking for Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I must have missed ‘em. Um, there are other folks here, too?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t worry about it. Can you show us the way to Lucas, please?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, well, yeah, sure!	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s another airlock hatch directly across from the one you came into this room from. You figure it just goes in deeper toward the center of the compound. However, on the right side of this room as you came in, there are two other hatches. And one of them has a plaque hanging over it that says “Lucas’ Private Quarters.” The scanner, the hand scanner that you’ve been using to open up all these airlocks - the hand scanner on this one is actually red, which you haven’t seen before. The other ones have been green and have opened pretty easily whenever you touch them. The other hatch isn’t illuminated at all. It looks like it’s completely powered down.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Those are the other two doors in this chamber.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Noelle? Before we go on, uhhhhhhh, tell us what’s with them other doors.	Magnus

Uh, you see some amethyst, a few very small pieces of diamond, you see some little slivers of pearl, all of them look like they are sort of broken off of, uh, bigger chunks. There’s some sapphire, there’s some ruby in there, but they’re all pretty small, but you estimate all these gemstones to be worth about 1200 gold pieces.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And inside isn’t actually a reflective mirror? Inside is actually just a circular disk of emerald. And it looks-- It looks flawless, this circular emerald disk. And it’s not reflecting your image, but as you look into it… [“The Cosmoscope” starts playing] You actually start to see some moving figures inside of it. And as they take form, you can see clear as day into this scene: You see two men sitting on a pretty comfortable-looking sofa with a big pitbull splayed out on top of them, and they’re looking at this flashing, illuminated box on the other side of the room. And then suddenly the image changes and you’re looking at sort of an older woman who’s sitting in the driver's seat of some sort of vehicle and she’s listening to the smoothest jazz in a line of other vehicles in front of a building with a sign with a big burger on top of it. And then you see another image. You see a young woman who’s curled up in, like, a bay window nook in a dark house. She’s watching a heavy snowstorm outside. She’s drinking tea and she looks like she’s tinkering with some sort of handheld device with these two glowing panels on it. And then you see another image of, like, a seedy bar where this three-piece rock band is playing to a pretty small crowd, but everyone in the crowd is singing along to every word of their songs. And then you see another image of an old man who’s asleep. He’s wearing what appear to be, like earmuffs. He’s in a large, metal tubular room with these rows of mostly-full seats and there’s a loud whirring noise in this room. You see a bundled-up woman hiking up a steep hill, and behind her, you see a brightly-lit city skyline that’s towering over this massive harbor full of boats, and the buildings in this skyline are taller than any you’ve ever seen before. And, like, every ten seconds or so, your perspective looking into this mirror just shifts, and it’s showing you more and more scenes of this impossible world.	Griffin

Um, there is-- as you look over, uh, the shutdown door, you see some holes. Like some very, very small holes in the, uh, wall, above the door. Uh, and there’s, like, a little-- you can see like a faint sort of impression, and it’s right where the plaque is on, uh, Lucas’s side, that says, “Lucas’s sleeping quarters.” Where that looks like it would be over this door, it’s just gone.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Um--	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Whose sleeping quarters was this?	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And right as you say that, uh, you hear a sound that sounds like, “WOOM”, and uh, as you turn to investigate the source of this sound, you see a rift in space, uh, about 20 feet in front of you, close to the central pillar in the middle of this room. And from out of that rift, you see a little chunk of pink tourmaline, and that pink tourmaline is illuminated from inside with a white light.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, and as soon as it pops through that rift, it falls to the ground. And as soon as it touches the ground, the room begins to transform. Uh, it starts to spread out from where that crystal touched the ground, and climbs up the pillar and spreads all over the ceiling, uh, it’s spreading all over the walls, and it, uh, takes over the whole room, and then, almost as soon as the transformation is complete, you begin to hear them tinkle-crinkles again. Oh, here they come, those tinkle-crinkles.	Griffin

NON-CONTENT			Yes.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, so you make your way into that airlock leading into the centre of the lab, um, and as you sort of clear that airlock and get inside of it, the, uh, the central pillar in the middle of the room just kind of explodes, sending shards of crystal shrapnel, uh, all over the room, um, although they just kinda stop in mid-air, right in front of the airlock that you came through, um, and the curious thing about like, the shards as they’re stuck in mid-air, is they form almost a perfect, like, dwarf shape, um, as if they were all targeting, uh... Merle... when they-- when they flew in your direction.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I just wanted to let y’all know, I-- I scanned that thing, just to like, try and figure out what it is, and it’s definitely, it’s of undead origin. But it’s got traces of divine energy, all around it. I’m trying to figure out-- do you guys know what’s going on? I don’t-- I’m not a big fan of that thing.	Noelle

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So, you’re in this airlock that’s in one of these branching pathways, and it’s leading towards two doors, uh, and they are labelled as follows. Um... the one going to the left is labelled the “Death Laser Calibration Chamber”, and the door on the right is labelled, “Large Humanoid Species Behaviour Modification Testing”. And then that sign is actually scratched out, and underneath it, uh, in sort of crude handwriting, is the word “hugbears”.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, as you pop open the room labelled “hugbears”, you, uh, enter into a pretty curious scene, and it’s unlike any room you’ve been on in Lucas’s lab so far.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s actually a pretty cosy-looking living room. Uh, and there’s a lit fireplace, and some-- uh, a mantle, with some family photos on it... but this room has been turned over, it almost looks like. There’s a couch that’s been overturned in the middle of the room, uh, with some scratches on it, there’s some smashed tea cups and spilled tea on the ground. There are a few potted plants that have been upended, that are weirdly like, writhing on the floor, um... and then right in the middle of the room, is basically just a giant hairy mass.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Yes.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And, uh, you can make out in this mass, four bugbears, uh, of various shapes and fur colorings, um, and they are all asleep. And one of ‘em actually has a really bad cut on his head, it looks like. But they are sleeping fairly soundly.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, Christy sets you down, Merle, and says, um,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry, I just thought-- I thought you were part -- we just got into kind of a skerfuffle and I thought you-- I thought you guys were a party to that.	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, we don’t party.	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, it’s fine, you didn’t interrupt nothin’, we were just takin’ a nap, we got hit with some sort of sleepin’ dust and uh--	Grizzled bugbear
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ugh. That’s the worst.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, no it’s not a good-- not a good night’s sleep,	Grizzled bugbear
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Who were these other people?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We should introduce ourselves.	Grizzled bugbear
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And one of the other bugbears goes:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, let’s, um, I guess we should go down the line. We’re-- so we’re bugbears.	Bugbear
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC: “The Hugbear Family” by Griffin McElroy (on SoundCloud)]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh huh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You probably figured that out already.	Bugbear

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re sorta... the help here-- we kinda help out around the place, and, uh... my name’s Aaron Styles.	Aaron
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Travis snorts]	stage

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And another one-- another one speaks up and goes, uh,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, my name’s Jamie Green, and, uh, I help tend to the plants and the stuff like that. I got kind of a green thumb, that’s sorta my joke that I do.	Jamie
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Merle, the one that attacked you says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And my name’s Christy Kilgore. And I’m sorta in charge of maintenance around here, but couldn’t think of like, a clever last name for maintenance so... I just went with-- I just kept my original name. My bugbear name.	Christy
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC FADES]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is this like a Jellicle Cats kind of situation, where these are the names Lucas gave you, but you have your own names for each other? Like these are like oddly human-ous names.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] -Yeah sure-- we’ve got our original names-- we have our bugbear names-- but we choose not to, sorta, remember that part of our lives ‘cause it was pretty... we used to do some pretty bad stuff out there out in the wild.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you guys-- or perhaps did you guys-- depending, I’m not really sure-- know Klaarg?	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[muffled wheezing]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All four of them look at you, Taako, immediately. Um, and Christy runs over to the airlock door, uh, and shouts,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait you-- you know Daniel? You saw Daniel out there?	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If that’s Klaarg, then... yeah..?	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Aaron walks over and sort of pulls Christy back, and is like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			S-- you’ll-- I’m sorry, how did you meet-- Klaarg was his original name, but when he lived here with us his name was Daniel, he’s my son, and... jeez. We’re all-- we’re all family here, y’know, we were a family tribe of bugbear that Lucas found and sort of adopted--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh huh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What... how did you meet Daniel? How--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well-- [crosstalk]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, was he Klaarg originally? And then he came here and switched to Daniel and went back to Klaarg, is that what’s up?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s hard to explain, you might-- you may wanna ask Lucas about it, it’s kinda-- the specifics-	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We totes will, he’s our buddy, I hugged him once, he gave us some Oolong, then he joined in a wacky racers thing with us, it was great--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is he safe? Is he alright?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] He’s totally fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s totally fine, he once saved my life.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s a good guy.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sounds like our Daniel.	John
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he’s actually the ursine formerly known as Daniel.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, he’s fine!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We saved him from some bad dudes, [choruses of agreement] he saved us from some stuff.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gosh, we sure do appreciate that. We miss Daniel a lot around here.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] No problemo!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we didn’t kill him or anything. Didn’t fight with him.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] He’s fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope. Didn’t kill--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, we need to check, he’s not dead.	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No, he’s not dead.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[defensively] No... he’s not dead.	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, Dad, this is us telling you. He’s not dead.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[defensively] Yeah, I know he’s not dead!	Clint
NON-CONTENT			Wha-- okay, now listen--	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Why do you keep saying that he is?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Here are the two ways people say that someone’s not dead: [normally] “Oh, he’s not dead” [exaggerated] “He’s not deeaad!” You’re doing the second one.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You’re falling into that second category, hard. You’re leaning into that category.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He’s not dead, he’s very much alive.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	He’s not [with strange inflection] dead?	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			You’re so bad at inflection.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			I like that one ‘cause it betrays the actuality of the situation, which is: I don’t know. It was ten episodes ago, I don’t remember.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	We did fight him though!	Clint
NON-CONTENT			No!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	He fell off the back of the car!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	No, the first time!	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Do you even listen to our show?	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Like we check back--	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	And then you met him again!	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	[crosstalk] and then we saw him again!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Did you think you killed him and that was a fucking bugbear ghost?	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			That helped you out in--	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			We record these! You can listen to these again.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He’s fine. Klaarg’s fine.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Klaarg’s fine.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. [exaggerated] Klaarg’s... fine.	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Justin and Travis laughing]	stage
NON-CONTENT			Um-- [crosstalk]	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright. Bugbears. Tell us about this other group you encountered before us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Aw, yeah, they were really rude! They came through, and we offered them, y’know, some tea, and we just... y’know, we asked how they were doin’ and they wanted to get by, and head inward-- towards the inner chambers in the lab. And we’re like, we can’t let that happen, of course, so we had sort of a disagreement--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, pardon?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, sorry?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We, um... totally gotcha, why- why can you not let-- hypothetically, a group of people pass by to get in?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, well that’s, like, sort of our thing, y’know-- we do our jobs around the place, but we’re also... we are still bugbears.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, so we’re like, really big, so we also do some light security work, um, for the lab as well. Y’know, we can’t really let folks--	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, what if Lucas said it was cool?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um... I guess that would be fine? He-- he didn’t tell us it was cool with this last group though, so uh--	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay. Well I…  [crosstalk]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was sort of a kerfuffle? There was a lil’ dwarf guy that attacked us, so we gave him a lil’-- a lil’ piece of our minds, there was a lizard lady, and she threw some sort of smoke bomb at us-- and we all went to dreamy-dream town.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They sound like dicks. [mumbled agreement from Merle]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I hated ‘em.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas? Can you hear me? Come in, Lucas--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. Yeah, okay, I guess you’ve sorta found out about one of my less ethical sort of experiments. Um...	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sounds fine. They seem great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Yeah, they’re really sweethearts.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, they really are-- they’re great-- they have these, um-- these inhibitors-- these inhibitor chips, in their brains, that I... I was trying to come up with a way to like, have people that would do some help for me around the lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Ohhhh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But also protect the lab from attackers, so I…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Slavery, right?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, [sighs] I guess, kind of, yeah a little bit, but they-- I mean, they seem genuinely happy, and y’know, they didn’t like being... all violent--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] So this is why we couldn’t charm Klaarg again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I saw, I watched what you guys did with Klaarg-- when I watched you on the races, and when I saw him pop up, I was a little bit surprised-- I gotta know, what did you guys do to him down there?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slowly] We charmed him.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s our buddy.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You used, like a charm spell on him? Klaarg, or as he was known here, Daniel Butler-- he was my butler-- he, um--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, you gotta get better at that. C’mon. A little subtlety.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Aw, no, I thought it was-- I thought it was cute. Anyway, um, he ran off-- he got into a little scuffle with his sister, and he bumped his head, and I think it disabled the inhibitor chip, and he had a freak-out. And he-- he ran off and escaped, and all I can think is that when you charmed him, somehow the wires got crossed in his brain? As it turns out, if you, like, inhibit all the aggression in a bugbear, they’re actually very sweet. Um, and so I that think he’s a bit on the fritz, Taako.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, right! Yeah, okay, now I remember-- I charmed him the first time we met him, to turn him into like, Kelsey Grammer?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mhm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think the odds are actually pretty good that he’s, maybe gonna be charmed by you forever, kind of like... on and off.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool!	Magnus
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He can join a nation of podcast listeners, [laughter] in that particular affliction.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, so, Luco-- need you to pass on to these, uh... these hugbears, that it’s totally cool for us to continue on our way unmolested.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah sure, uh, hey guys, you just gotta let ‘em pass, okay? They’re trying to get in-- into the middle.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we go, will you tell us just just a little bit more about the scuffle? Was there a problem with the scuffle?	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, like, we were-- we don’t wanna be rude, we try to be real nice here, as-- as much as we can, but yeah these-- these three, um. Honestly it was just the dwarf guy that was mostly sorta causin’ all the trouble, honestly reminds me of back in my day, um, one time a guy came into my cave and I just killed ‘em!	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. We’ve all been there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I definitely killed some guys who came into my cave, too.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just feel like if that happens, you throw ‘em right off a cliff? And it’s usually fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, I’ve thrown plenty of people off cliffs,	Jamie
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Several “yeah”s]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s uh, cliff-throwing is what bugbears do best, really.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We should compare notes-- so we need to keep on movin’.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s all about the angle. The angle --	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think it’s about the dangle, but that’s just me.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I guess I-- I guess we can let you through, if Lucas has vouched for ya. So can ya tell me what’s goin’ on in this lab? ‘Cause I’ve heard lots of crinkle-tinkles--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, you guys need to get movin’. Uh...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, this is not a cool scene, you need to move on out.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, do you wanna come with us?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess we could, but like--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[in a deep voice] SWEAR FEALTY!	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[in the same deep voice] Swear to me!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[normally] Sorry, I don’t know where that came from.	Taako
NON-CONTENT			[crosstalk] It seems like--	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			-you’re welcome to join us, but you just have to [deep voice] swear fealty!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I... is he okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] I’m fine.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should just do that, though.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle says, um,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, hold on, it might be kinda dangerous ‘cause it’s all crystallized out there.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s why I’m saying they should come with us, ‘cause they can’t go out that way, they have to keep moving inward.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but there could be other parts of it-- why don’t you-- I’ll tell you what, you four just lock yourselves in the airlock when we leave. You’ll be safe in there, until we, we can come get ya.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I think that’s Griffin’s DM way of not having to do six voices for the rest of the campaign.	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Justin and Clint laughing]	stage
NON-CONTENT			Yuuup.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well actually, at this point it’s like 8 voices, cause you got also like, two different radios.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s true.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	This whole thing’s gotten wildly outta hand.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	We’re gonna elect one of us to speak for the others.	Justin

NON-GAME_RELATED			Oh, like Sliders?	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Well, like David Slime-covny.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, can we get y’all anything? Before we-- before you go?	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, can we get you a tea or somethin’? Can I give you guys a quick shave, or--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I can cook you up a nice meal. I can make y’all a -a ham steak?	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Y’all have been lovely. Um, we have got to mosey. Uh… Farewell, we’ll never forget you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We will never forget our time--	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess you don’t wanna know where the Bugbear Treasure is buried.	John
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[sounds of protest]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, where is the bugbear treasure?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Naw, just kiddin’. I’m just playin’.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey wait, I have a question real quick. Why is there a second dormitory out there, do you guys know? If you’re like, doing the day-to-day stuff. There was Lucas’s room, and then there was like an empty room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, well that was... well that was Maureen’s room.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Maureen...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Maureen. Y’know. Lucas’s mom?	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Gotcha.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah she’s, um. She’s-- she’s not with us anymore unfortunately.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Where is she?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um... I should probably, uh--	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[whispering] I think she’s dead.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should probably ask Lucas about that, when, um. You know, like, later on. You guys, um, should probably get a move on.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh huh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I get this feeling that the base is sinking, and we all don’t wanna die.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. No, I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya. Um... did Maureen die?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. God, how indelicate can you be, bud?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I didn’t know her--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he could’ve asked Lucas.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. Um, I can talk to you guys about that later, let’s just-- can we get this show on the--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, Lucas can hear. That’s right. Sorry dude! We keep going.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool. [Griffin trying not to laugh] Cool talk. Pretty cool day I’m having with you guys, my three friends.	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Magnus laughing nervously]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C’mon Noelle!	Merle
NON-CONTENT			Okay, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You guys say your goodbyes to the, uh, to the bugbears, to the hugbear family. And as you leave the hugbear room, uh, you pass through an airlock that is just like a straight tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and this one, uh, this-- this single door is labelled, “Hugbear supply room”. Um, and uh, it’s where all the hugbears’ cleaning supplies, cooking supplies, all of the supplies they need to do their work around the lab, uh, are. And as you enter into it, you realize that this room has already been crystallized. And there’s some shelves, with supplies all over, it just looks like a big storeroom. Even through your suits you can feel, uh, this room is actually really cold. You realize it’s actually because there’s a small vent to the outside of the lab in this room, and there’s some snow blowing into the room, that’s actually instantly crystallizing and uh, falling to the ground, so there’s like a crunchy layer of crystallized snow--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	And how cool would you say that looks?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It looks pretty neat, actually. It’s like a little crystal confetti cannon, coming into the room. Unfortunately, right underneath that window, you see a crystallized figure. And it’s pretty small? And it’s wearing a null suit, only the helmet is open in that null suit, and you see a dwarven figure with a cigar in its mouth.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh god, it’s Merle!	Magnus
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[sad music starts playing]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s Merle from the future.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No… Boyland is closed for good.	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint guffaws]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The sad thing is he’ll never get to be Manland.	Taako
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Why did he take off his helmet? He was always so stupid.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	We probably just high-fived, by the way. In fiction. I don’t know if that matters.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah, okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So here’s a crystallized Boyland, um, he has his helmet open, and he has a pretty grim look on his face	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			[laughing] yeah!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And he’s got his cigar in his mouth that he had when you guys first came in through here. When you guys first crash-landed into the laboratory. And he’s sitting right under the window where the snow is coming in.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I wave my hand and see if his eyes move.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			[chuckling] No…	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Oh, okay.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			[chuckling] … No…	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I thought maybe I could get him out!	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s fuckin’ savage, Travvy.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Well.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I barely knew him before, and I won’t even know him now.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	He volunteered at the Boys and Girls Club. The Boys and Dwarves Club- every single weekend. He, um... What else can I say- he had a gigantic family.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Oh my god.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	He was the father of four hundred sons and thirteen daughters, which is weird.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	That’s why he’s called Boyland.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Yeah, ‘cause they spring from him. Fully formed. And boy, was he just a great dad. He had a big old camping trip for all 413 of his kids planned for actually next week.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Euuuugh.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, shit.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	And he was two days away from retirement.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			And, he was--	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Uh, for camping?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	The camping tickets?	Travis & Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No, that’s a good point. You would have to rent out like a whole forest to get all those kids up in the mix.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Um, anyway, he was the sweetest guy, sorry I did a bad job sort of storytelling, I guess, for him.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			In this, in his brief eulogy it’s a shame that only now--	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Do I have a marker or something with me that I can draw like a smiley face on his face?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah sure.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Does he have anything worth stealing that we could take?	Clint
NON-CONTENT			Hey!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	It’s all covered in crystals, right?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	No actually, he has a weapon. It’s kind of a small handaxe that he’s got.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I take it.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Why would you take that?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s just a one-handed axe, it doesn’t look like anything special but it was coated in the null-suit juice when he got sprayed down. So, yeah, that would be protected, but him... he’s all froze.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s too bad.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I take the axe.	Clint
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	[dice] That is a 19 versus AC?	Griffin
MECHANICS		YES	Now, to be fair— when he enters the zone, is his speed halved?	Travis
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[agreement from Clint]	stage
NON-CONTENT			Well, it's the first time a creature—	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No, but anytime it's in the zone, their speed is halved.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Yeah, I haven't really been tracking speed because we're in a weightless zero-G-like inertia.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Well, that's what I'm saying, so he would've slowed down enough.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Okay yeah no, that's fair. That's fair. Fair play.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	He's not gonna be able to get close enough to take a bite out of you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	So instead he's just gonna try and Yoshi-tongue you to try and bring you in range.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear him go like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			AH-AUUUUUUGH! Not again! UHHH.	Tardigrade

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Not really, not anymore. One of them is... they're probably about 10 feet away from each other. One of them has a tongue attached to a big refrigerator, and the other one is sort of still back towards the big pile of debris.	Griffin

There are three airlocks leading to the med bay, one leading to-- one labeled to go to the main elevator, and one heading to a room called Cosmoscope. And then right next to you, right next to the door that you just exited from, is the airlock leading into the Thermal Regulation Chamber, which also has a layer of ice around it.

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, it's Pan, look behind you! You fool!	Whisper
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	All right all right, I turn around and look behind me.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You look behind you while everybody's busy get-getting to this door, heeding this voice that apparently only you can hear, and you see a small rift open in space, and you see the crystal with the white fire starting to come through it. And that voice says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, listen, you have to trust me. It's me, Pan. You have to grab the crystal. Grab it with your hands before it touches the ground! You can stop this room from getting crystallized! You can save your friends! Grab the crystal!	Whisper
NON-CONTENT			[skeptical] Hmmmmm...	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the thing's starting to pop out of this rift-womb, and make its way out.	Griffin

STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Justin gasps]	stage

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as soon as you grab it you hear that voice again, and it goes,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[changes to Cockney accent] Oh, well, this is gonna be a lot easier than I thought!	Whisper
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you hear a sound like a light bulb shattering as the crystal in your hand just kind of, kind of shatters and fractures into splinters, and you feel a sharp pain in your hand. And that sharp pain is kinda replaced by this strange numbness.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as you open up your hand, you realize that you have a few little needles of this crystal sticking out of your hand.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Okay...	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[singing] Choppin' away at the door...	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And your hand is starting to get— starting to change. Hand is actually starting to turn— turn— the suit, I should say, around your hand and your arm, you can feel it, like it hurts a whole bunch.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I can't even describe how bad it feels.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But yeah, your hand is starting to turn into pink tourmaline.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[overlapping] I turn around and chop it off.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Hey wait!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Okay... yeah, it's grown up to his forearm... how do you, I guess my question is, how would you know...?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, he's probably screaming by this point. Unless he's just like super cas’ [short for ‘casual’] about the whole arm turning into crystal thing. "Huh, that's weird!"	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	What's turning into crystal, the suit, or my arm?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	All of it. The whole kit and caboodle. It's growing up, it's up your wrist now, it's about halfway up your forearm.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Would it help if I took the suit off?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's like, already in your body, it seems like?	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No!	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let me chop it off!	Magnus
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Travis, that seems like a very personal character choice you're making for Dad right now. I don't think you should decide whether or not he wanders this earth as a one-armed dwarf.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, I'm— but I want you to know that Magnus, in character, is screaming, "Let me chop it off!"	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's fine, but you can't say you chop it off!	Justin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He is an arm removal specialist.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wow, that's a really good point.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, do you want me to freeze it? Maybe I should freeze it?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don't know if freezing it would do any good!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, it's better than chopping it off—	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, is that all Noelle did? You bitch at us for not using her and then I try to use her and she just goes "Oh, poopie!"	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I can't–I can’t like... I can't anti-crystal you! Somebody do something!	Noelle

STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Justin is laughing so hard they're snorting]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Why did Pan lie to me? [Griffin starts to interject; Justin is dying of laughter in the background] Oh, it wasn't Pan, was it. Shhhhit.	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And that is your last thought as a two-armed man, as Magnus brings Railsp— Magnus brings Merlesplitter down just above the elbow, and you hear a grisly cra- cra-snump.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Justin is completely losing it in the background]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wait wait wait, at least below the elbow, come on. Not above.	Clint

MECHANICS		NO	And uh, go ahead and roll damage, Magnus.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	Let's see... two-handed... [dice] That is 7 + 6, so 13.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	I feel like damage should be reduced, though.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Because it's, he's not aiming to cause damage to Merle.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I don't want him to half cut off my arm!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I guess, but like— okay, well, I guess that's true, yeah.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			All right.	Justin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sings] Oh shiiiiit, sweet fliiiiiiips...	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	Wait a minute, who's carrying me, the guy that just chopped my arm off? Or the guy that just let it happen?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You basically just begged him to.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	"I'm totally unconscious over here! Nothing to add!"	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	"I'm unconscious as hell!"	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your whole party, the three of you— Merle, you're unconscious— with Noelle and Carey and Killian, rush in through the airlock towards the med bay as just chunks of this room that has become crystallized start to break up and start to— it looks like this thing is self-forming again, but you don't really stick around long enough to watch it put itself together into some sort of grisly monster.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	With Merle's arm floating in the middle.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, Merle's arm is actually part of the mix. You see this thing using Merle's arm as part of its form, but you don't really see how it ends up in the production.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And yeah, you hoof it through the med bay. As you go through the airlock, before you actually get into the med bay, you reach a sign that says, “Decontamination Chamber,” and as you open it up, it's actually a pretty small chamber that has some medical equipment in it, and what looks like an observation bay, but this whole room has also been completely crystallized.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Ah, bummer.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you pass through that, and through another airlock, you do actually make it into the med bay, and there you see Lucas, for the first time since you met him in the voidfish's chambers.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, fix my friend! I don't know what happened!	Magnus
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[wheezy laughter]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Lucas— Lucas has a big bandage on his head? He has a big, like, bloody bandage on his head?	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You said you needed us to give you a hand!	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Travis, Clint, and Justin all do comedy "Ah!" reactions]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Seriously, what did you guys—	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Before he can finish that sentence, Killian actually grabs him and picks him up. And is like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This has been the worst, shittiest day ever, we are two people down, your lab SUCKS.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Fix my friend!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You better put me down if you want me to help him!	Lucas

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Meanwhile, bleed bleed bleed bleed bleed!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas grabs him like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Help me put him up on this table. Magnus, use your big strong- your big strong- [Travis: Fishlifters.] arm-removing arms—	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I do it.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How ironic that your big strong arms are only good at one thing, and that's removing other people’s arms.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. It's very ironic.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I put him on the table.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, he starts to rustle around in a drawer—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Full of spare dwarf arms...	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It's full of spare dwarf arms, and he just like, sticks one on, and you're just fine.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Uh, no, he actually pulls out a syringe and jams it into Merle's arm, um, and you— it regrows.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	No.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			It’s, uh...	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The bleeding starts to slow a little bit, Merle, you actually wake up a little bit, you gain a little bit of consciousness as you feel this needle go into you—	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			AAAAAAAH SHITTTT!	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	But.. the… I can't tell if that was real or not.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s a very good actor.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			That's 'cause I'm an actor.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was really terrific.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But this thing is actually numbing your grisly wound pretty significantly. It's bringing you some pain relief.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Not so much HP relief.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you're not in a horrific amount of pain anymore.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Killian's in the corner, she's using, she is speaking to the Director through a stone, and just like checking in, letting the home base know the situation, and Lucas asks, like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What has been goin' ON out there? What are you guys doing? What happened to Merle?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he uh-	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I got disarmed.	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's pretty good.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He started to crystallize, we were chopping on a door and magicking a door, then we heard Noelle scream, then we turned around, his hand was turning to crystal, and then his arm was turning to crystal, and I heroically - valiantly - chopped his arm off, against my wishes— he begged me— and I cut his arm off so that he wouldn't all crystal. And...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, listen, let me stop you right there. Lucas isn't your dad. You chopped your dad's arm off. You don't owe Lucas any explanation. Get us the fuck out of here!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slurred, moaning] You dirty prick, I can't believe you did this to me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And now he's drunk.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh the pain, kill me!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t- We can't get out of here, we can't get out of here until we manage to stop the base from sinking into the sea and crystallizing the whole world. Did you forget why we're here in the first place? 'Cause I— well, I—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's been like four episodes, my dude.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's because I fucked up an experiment pretty bad. But we— that's not, this, the arm thing's not on me, I don't think!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it was crystallizing—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I blame that on everybody!	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[woozy laughing]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, can you hear me?	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'll say it a different way. Godddddddddd liiiiiiiiiiied toooo meeee.	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I turn to Lucas.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, there you have it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I guess God lied to him, that's what I'm picking up from the situation.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then some British guy [slurs] threw a crystal at me, and I grabbed it, and it hurt.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Some British guy...	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I heard all of that, um, okay... I, I, it's that being. It's that being that's been attacking my lab. I don't know what the fuck that thing is, but I'm so sorry that you guys had to get mixed up in this. I didn't want any of this, you have to believe me.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think it was that guy that was married to Katy Perry. [Travis: Russell Brand?] It sounded like that— Russell Brand. It sounded like Russell Brand took my hand.	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[wild laughter]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, is Russell Brand here?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, he's not, hold on—	Lucas

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, god, you went in my room?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I did, it was a fucking mess! And it looked like somebody stole all your gems before we got there.	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Carey, I need you to get over to the bugbears and tell Jamie Green to bring me these supplies right now, or you can bring them back, tell her to give you these supplies and get back to me as quick as you can.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she says, uh,	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	[Magnus: Aw…] And he's doing some work, the bleeding is stopped, he's wrapped a big bandage around it— Merle— so it doesn't seem like Merle's gonna die, and he goes over to a desk in his corner and he starts tinkering with some stuff. He takes off his belt—	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Whoa whoa whoa!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don't worry about it! I've got a plan!	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he's working with it, he's got this petri dish that he's like mixing some sort of fluid in... and he's like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As much as I want to, we can't leave, we can't get him out of here until we stop this thing from spreading. I, I, [sighs] I was down in the lower chambers of my lab—	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Late one night…	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			 One night, and—[Griffin forgets the words to "Monster Mash"] monster boy? How does it— anyway— I was attacked by one of my robots. And I came up here to the medbay to, you know, treat my wound, and when I tried to leave, I found that crystal monster, or whatever it is— it's not, the monster itself isn't crystal, it's what's inhabiting the crystals— it attacked me in the decontamination chamber, and so I, I made my way back here into the med bay, and I flooded the room with anti-Conjuration energy because obviously, he's traveling between planes to move from spot to spot, [Magnus: Obviously.] so I blocked it off— obviously, come on, that's like, 101— you guys figured that out by now, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yep.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I, guys, I'm just so sorry, I promise, I'll get him patched up, I have an idea for how to patch him up, and we're gonna be able to, you'll see, we'll get out of this and we'll get down to my lower levels and I'll stop the crystal from spreading and— mission accomplished!

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey everybody, this is Lucas, the fictional character. I do want to step outside of kayfabe for a second and tell you, for real though, the thing about the refrigerators, that one was on me, and if I had taken it off, I'm pretty sure Merle would still have both of the arms.

ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	Um... Dad does have a hand ax, he announced it in episode one, but it's basically a hatchet, it's like a hatchet that they would use in like— a child would get for Christmas—	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Like you would use in the book... Hatchet?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Like a Gary Paulsen hatchet.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Hence the name Li'l Choppy.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I also wanna say, the reason we didn't use the red barrels [during the tardigrade fight] is because we beat them anyways, pretty handily.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	I don't think we took a lot of damage.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	We didn't need the red barrels, and it wasn't until afterwards when all you punks got to hear Griffin say "the red barrels" that you went yeah— [crosstalk] like— hindsight, 20/20, you guys.	Travis

ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	While Dad's rolling that die to tell you which hand got got, I should also mention that very early in the show, I also said that whenever people are around Taako, they get super horny and want to give him lots of money. I said that and everybody was like, uh huh, good good good good.	Justin

NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Merle, you've been treated.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What I'm trying to establish is, you're actually doing okay. Aside from, you're missing your right arm. And by right arm, it's mostly your forearm, it kind of just kind of stops at the elbow, and you're really thoroughly bandaged up on that arm. The bleeding has come to a stop.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Things have calmed down in the past, in the twenty minutes that have passed.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	And just to be clear, when last we left, Merle had explained to us that he heard a British guy, [Griffin: Yeah.] who tricked him, [Griffin: Yes.] and then Lucas, if I remember correctly, said, "I'll explain everything."	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, Lucas right now is actually in the corner, he's actually removed a panel from the wall of this medbay and you can see he's got some sort of like hastily constructed terminal that he's like, rewiring some stuff in the panels, and he's like, fiddling with this terminal, and as he does, you can hear sort of rumbling and some ambient noises coming from pretty far off in the lab. And in this medbay, now that things have calmed down, you've actually got a chance to sort of take in your surroundings. There's some cabinets with medical equipment and medicines, there is some sort of scanning device, and there is a null suit chamber, much like the one that you guys had in the Bureau of Balance, it's maybe a little bit smaller than the one that you have in your lab that you used to suit up at the beginning of this adventure, and hanging off of the side of it are— is a suit, that is Lucas-sized, it is human-shaped.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas stops messing with this panel that he's fiddling with, and he goes,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I've rewired and shut down most of the rest of my lab, it should buy us about an hour and a half to get downstairs and shut this thing down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That should give us about an hour and 29 minutes for you to explain what the holy hell is going on, and one minute to get downstairs.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sigh] There... [sigh] what don't, what don't you already know? Some— There was an accident, and somebody—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oookay, what don't we know? I got a compact, lets me see into some strange world, A. B, there's a voice that keeps talking to us. C, some British guy more or less took Merle's hand. D, what the fuck is happening?	Magnus

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, some British guy—	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He's exorcised himself from the story, huh— [crosstalk]	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Listen, if you— if somebody got stabbed with a sword would you say the sword killed him? No. I was merely the tool that operated on Merle, through this British guy— I was a tool.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Travis is telling his shield, "I don't know, I never cut his hand off… "	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So this is like, guns don't kill people…	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus takes axes, kills arms.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Got it.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Actually, before we get started, Merle, I had an idea. Because we're gonna need your clerical ways as we go deeper, and I was thinking, I had a kind of idea of how I could maybe restore some of your two-handedness? If that makes sense?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm listening. I'm a little grumpy, [Lucas: Okay.] as everybody can understand...	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	A little put off.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Magnus, I understand that you may have taken a little trophy from Hodge Podge after defeating him. Can I see it?	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes it, and uh—	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	God, I was so hoping Griffin would say no.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes the right arm and he holds it up to Merle, and it's really little.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It's like a small, like a doll's arm. Like a toy, like a GI Joe arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He's like,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I'm just— I'm just kidding, that would be... that would be ridiculous, it's like a little toy arm. Like if I could somehow plug this into you, how would you control it? That's sci-fi bullshit. Robot arms.	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Today the part of Merle being played by Kristen Wiig.	Clint
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He actually goes back to that desk where he was messing around with a belt and a petri dish, where he was messing around, and you see him—	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can I have that arm back please?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I need a piece off of it.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He unscrews this, like, cap at the end of it, and attaches it to this thing that he's tinkering with. And as he's tinkering with it, Carey comes back into the room, and she says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, I'm back! I got what you asked me to get from Jamie.	Carey
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And she is holding a potted plant with these four wooden shoots, it looks like, coming out of it.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	And if you'll recall, you saw this very briefly when you went into the bugbear chamber.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas goes,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, no, this is the idea. This is going to be great.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	YES	And he takes that plant and removes it, de-pots it, takes it out, and as he's like taking it out of the pot and shaking the dirt off of its roots, you actually see the plant kind of protest? Like it's like trying to slap his hand away? And he plants it in this petri dish that you can see has some sort of green viscous fluid in it, and he sprays it down with something. He picks it up, and it just kind of looks like this wooden plant is hanging off of this belt. And he creates—	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Feed me, Lucas!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He creates some sort of concoction that he walks over to Merle, and he says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here, drink this. Trust me. Please. This is gonna be so sick. This is— Merle, I know you’ve been burned by people asking you to do stuff that maybe you don’t trust, in the past like 15 minutes, but trust me on this, this is gonna be tight as hell.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sure. I’ll do it. Yeah.	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your other arm falls off.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm really down, so, yeah, go ahead, kick me while I— I'm vulnerable, I feel very vulnerable right now.	Merle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, so you're downing this bev…	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Mm!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It's like an appletini!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It actually tastes more like a carbonated wheatgrass shot.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			[Justin: Nice.]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It doesn't taste especially great. But as you taste it, and as you drink it, you see this wooden— these four wooden shoots hanging off of this belt kind of come to a standstill and start to wrap around each other and tie around each other, and they form what looks like kind of a crude four-fingered arm.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC: ???]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Lucas explains, he says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so biology's not my specialty, but this is definitely gonna work. This is a plant called soulwood, and it's a psychically tuned plant that can resonate with certain people that resonate with them, and it can sort of change its biology based on the whims of other living creatures. And Merle, from what I understand, plants are kind of your specialty, um, so—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Romantically.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Romantically speaking. So, my thinking is— do you mind? I'm gonna get close, I'm gonna get intimate.	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Hell yes, ASMR.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He starts whispering in nerd ASMR.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low nasal whispering] Okay, so what it's gonna do…	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He takes this belt and wraps it around your shoulder, and then there's another fastener which goes around your chest, and as he's doing this—	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Merle, how do you feel about auto-erotic asphyxiation?	Magnus
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as he's doing this, he is straight up, like, Army of Darkness, attaching this wooden arm to you that is now roughly the size— it's actually kind of bigger than your other arm—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I chop it off.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh no. That didn't last very long at all, huh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	No, I don't.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Not this time.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, you have this wooden arm, and you feel this like, this psychic link with it. You feel like a deep connection with this arm made up of these four wooden shoots that have twisted around each other to form the shape of an arm.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Awesome...?	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So I guess it all worked out!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, everything worked out for the best!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Worked out fine.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I want you to feel completely off the hook, Magnus.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then Magnus and Merle engage in a very complicated like high five secret handshake so he can test out the hand, we do the Shimmy Shimmy Cocoa Pop, the Bureau handshake—	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, as you do the secret Merle and Magnus handshake, Merle, you feel like it is not a big deal to move this thing at all. It takes maybe a little bit to become as dextrous with it as you were your original OG dwarf hand, but yeah, you have pretty good control over this soulwood arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it actually like kind of curls up towards you and gives you a big thumbs-up as if to say, hey! I'm your arm now!	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wow! Creepy! Really creepy! Yeah! Good. That's really gonna cut back on my fireworks—	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I want it in the canon—	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And hey, good news, now you got somebody to blame for your rolls. [Travis laughs] It's the tree!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I want it in the canon that Magnus is actually like a little bit jealous of his sweet new wooden arm. Not out loud, mind you, but just quietly to himself.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And I would like it in canon that Magnus can kiss my Kenny Chesney tattoo.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Fair. All of this is fair.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Can you imagine what delectable torture that would be though, for Magnus, to have a tree on his arm that he cannot split.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah, true…	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, he can.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Can Magnus make a tree even he can’t split?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	So in terms of mechanics, Merle, you now have just a permanent disadvantage on sleight of hand rolls.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's just— your days of having good sleight of hand rolls are behind you.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	My days of having any good rolls are behind me!	Clint
NON-CONTENT			But!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You can now control this hand separately from yourself. You can take it off, chuck it, control it like you would normally, [Travis: What?] like your hand, only you can control it remotely.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Awesome.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So it gave him superpowers, basically. Great.	Justin

STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[snickering]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so we don't have a lot of time for you to get acclimated to your new arm, so you're gonna have to figure it out on the fly, but before we get out there, you're gonna need to recharge your suits.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Noelle says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh! That's right! Oh gosh! Sorry, I completely blanked. And a little compartment opens up and a tank pops out that looks very much like the tank of spray that they plugged into the chamber when you first got sprayed down to null-suit yourselves. And Lucas slips into his null suit and plugs the tank into the chamber, and he's like,	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, everybody, pile on in! It's time to recharge!	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And I guess very awkwardly, because there's more of you now, you're doing like a Real World/Road Rules like, how many co-eds can we fit into a phone booth challenge... you all get coated in another layer of null-suit juice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The meters, you have these little panels on your wrist that are showing how much energy you have left in your null suits, are completely full up now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And everybody gets all sprayed down.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			And may I say, in Amazon reviews, I'm giving the null suits originally one thumbs down…	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			[laughs] That's not how Amazon reviews work.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I couldn't pass up a thumb joke.	Clint

STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When Merle—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're standing on my thigh, which is weird.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thank you for the boost. When Merle mentioned a British guy, did that ring any bells for you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay. I swear, guys? The lying stuff? Is over now. I have no fucking idea what—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you realize that like this is an all-audio medium, so all I can do is ask questions, right? I can't look around and observe…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I get it. Um, if you want, I can tell you all about the compact…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah! That'd be cool!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It'll be easier if I show you the Cosmoscope. Can you guys— are you guys ready to roll?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you make your way into the door that you saw earlier that was labeled 'The Cosmoscope.' And as you pass through the airlock into the Cosmoscope you enter into what you assume to be a pretty large chamber, although it is like, completely pitch black in here.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Save for a pillar of light which is illuminating what looks like a circular disk that is kind of free-floating in the middle of the room, facing you.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the tale of the... [stalling] old... sailor's... mummy!	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, he flips some switches on this lectern and you see an image pop up on this disk, and it looks like the lab that you are currently standing in, as seen from above, from outside of the lab. And he says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I’m about to get into some pretty heavy concepts. Um, I’m probably going to blow your whole mind and just kinda reshape the way you think about existence and stuff. So if it ever gets to be too much or you have any questions, please feel free to stop me, okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay wait stop: you’re blowing my mind.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay. Boy, this is gonna take forever, I bet. Let’s take this slow. My whole life, I have been obsessed with the concepts of taxonomy and hierarchy. For everything that exists, there’s always a bigger thing that contains it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s always someone cooler than you, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s one way of putting it, yeah. So there’s always a bigger thing that has a bigger thing that contains it, and so on and so forth, repeated on to just inconceivable degrees.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down. Turtles all the way up. Bigger turtles. So…	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he points to this disk in the middle of the room, and he says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so this is my lab. We can go way deeper on, like, the micro scale. To, like, elementary particles and stuff like that. But for the lightweight version of this demonstration, let’s start here. Here’s my lab.	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Got it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he holds up two index fingers, and does, like, an iPhone pinch-- pinches them together, and the image pans out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see it zoom out, and now you can see the Stillwater Sea underneath his lab.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so here it is floating over the Stillwater Sea --	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he pinches the screen again.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s that sea in relation to the neighboring landmasses, and here’s the whole continent, Faerûn. And here’s our whole world, Abeir-Toril.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How’d you do that?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just bear with me. You’re gonna go way way further. [Magnus: What?] Here’s our solar system. [Magnus: Huh??] Here’s the local interstellar cloud, [Magnus: What?] the local bubble, the local arm, the galaxy…	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as he’s doing this, you’re seeing the entire galaxy, spiraling. And it’s beautiful. You’ve never seen anything quite like it.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s the local group -- [Magnus: I’ve seen it.] ...Oh. [Laughs] Okay. I wanna actually ask you guys about that here in a minute, but here’s the local group, the local cluster, the local supercluster, and so on and so forth, until… Here!	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s all just a collar on a cat!	Travis
NON-CONTENT			[Laughing] It’s, uh, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the observable universe. This is everything we know, every place we’ve ever been, every person we’ve ever met, every place anyone’s ever been, is in here. But more importantly, so are the immutable rules that govern the people, places and things inside of this universe. Things like gravity and thermodynamics and arcane interactions. And all that stuff, all that matter and energy and the rules that govern it, comprise this. Our universe. You guys are just a handful of people who have ever seen the observable universe before, so. It’s pretty cool, right? [crosstalk]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, is there like a guest book we need to sign, or...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Deep voice] Hey, listen, uh, listen. What if I was to take one step past what you’ve shown me here?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, can I say something?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s up?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve just made me very, very happy.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He walks to the back of the room-	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And also, just to clarify, horny. [crosstalk]	Taako
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It all ties together.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			- and also, you have a deep desire to give me a lot of money.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve made me very horny.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	–he says, and he flips a switch on that lectern, and the whole room lights up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the disk in the middle that you were just looking at is made of some sort of dark, bluish-green material, in a perfect circle with some silvery trim all around it, and this disk is levitating. But you realize, as the lights go up, this room is filled with these disks.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC: The Cosmoscope starts]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they’re all arrayed in orbit around this central disk in rings around it. And there’s ten other of these disks in the room and they’re all different colors -- bright reds and oranges and greens and blues and whites -- and they’re all displaying a wide array of scenes of impossible things.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You look into this red disk, [Magnus: Like what?]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	you see a world that looks kind of like the world, if the world was made completely out of lava and fire. And then there’s a blue disk where it’s just a giant ocean, a world made of water and ice. You see a world where millions and millions of these living lights just float weightlessly through the air and worlds where oceans of magical energy wash up on shores made of these brilliant white sands--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	There’s a name for that one. It’s Ibiza.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where everything's the same except everybody's got mustaches…	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	You see, well, no, that’s not one of them, but you see all of these, like, incredible worlds and you don’t know where to look--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Uh, I would. I would look at Buffet Planet back there, couple planets back.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, to answer your question, this is the next thing that’s bigger. This is our planar system. This, this, this disk, that you see, that represents our observable universe, this is actually our plane. This is the prime material plane. We’re smack-dab in the middle of the planar universe. And each of these are different planes of existence, and they, they each produce unique energies and they share these energies. They inform the material and physical make-up of, of, of each other. They each have connections, some are more tenuous than others. But these make up the real existence, uh -- each plane having its own sort of energies and rules. This, this is what’s bigger than the universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then what’s bigger than that?	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Good question.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Thank you.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, let’s start with this: There are six building block planes, right?	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And these, he points to these disks that are on the outermost ring away from the prime material plane disk that’s in the middle of the room. And he goes:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So you’ve got your elemental planes: Fire, air, water, earth. And then you got the planes of light and shadow. [Magnus: Heart?] No. Taako, certainly, you probably know a little bit about these during your studies at Wizard U.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low and raspy voice] Yeah, I’ve gotten balls-deep in some of those other planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think he’s got a secret room in one of ‘em.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When I use Blink, I get all up in those other planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s right. When you use Blink, you end up in the ethereal plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn’t list that amongst your planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, there’s more. I’m gonna run through them. But if you actually look --	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can actually see underneath the disk that you were looking at first, where you’re looking at your own universe, you actually see another disk underneath it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s like:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That one is the ethereal plane, and it’s kind of like a filter. It’s like where the raw energies of the rest of the planes are kinda filtered into the prime material plane so it’s not just like, everything’s on fire or drowning all the time. So yeah, anyway, that’s the seventh, and then we got the planes that sort of inform the energies of life itself, like the plane of magic where magic energy is born. And then on the opposite end of that, you see there’s the plane of thought which is the source of logic and reason and emotion.	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So the boring one.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, as you actually look into the plane of thought, which is this deep green emerald mirror, you see similar scenes to the things that you saw in the compact, Magnus. You see a large, wide, gray road with a bunch of vehicles just sort of sitting stuck on it.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Metal dragons!	Magnus
NON-CONTENT			Yeah!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see scenes like you saw in the compact.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So this plane is where all the creativity and energy for this world comes from. The creation.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah! It’s like where the home of logical thought is. That’s why I call it the plane of thought.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Show me Donald Trump!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t... know quite who that is. Although, the fact that you guys make so many references to this world makes me think you have to have spent some time there at some point.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a little house there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t tell if you’re joking, which is like, kinda par for the course. Anyway, there’s the other higher planes, there’s the celestial plane, which is inhabited by the beings that I guess some people would consider deities.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s the meat plane, the vegetable plane, the dairy plane, the breads plane…	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Soluble fats plane…	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but you only wanna visit that one sometimes!	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plain plane, that's not very exciting.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plane plane, that's just full of planes.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the plain plane plane with all these plain planes in the plane.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, you gotta be careful with that one.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been working on a new version of the food pyramid, to kinda educate the people of Faerûn, but it’s kinda like a cube? And it’s for people who like to party.	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, hey, listen, I gotta be honest. From me to you, that sounds dope as hell.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[continuing from before the comedic tangent] And then the prime material plane, the ethereal plane, you know about those. And then the astral plane, which is where our unconscious forms -- our souls -- retire when we die here in the prime material plane.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is Merle’s arm there?	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute! Wait a minute! That goes completely against my theology. Is there a Pan plane?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please respect his beliefs.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, Pan probably kicks it in the celestial plane.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Actually, as he was talking about the astral plane, you realize he’s talked about 12 different planes but there are only 11 in the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The astral plane -- so anyway, let me explain. Crystals, certain types of gemstones, if grown into a perfect circle -- they can’t be cut! If you cut it, it doesn’t work. They have to be naturally grown in a perfect circle -- resonate with the different planes of existence. With the twelve planes that form our planar system, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, everybody knows that.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s 101.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Literally nobody outside this family knows that, until now.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I knew it.	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We talked about it yesterday. You remember that, Merle?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Frustrated] Yeah, okay, so-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, when I wasn’t speaking to you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[lower voice] Hey, listen, little man, these guys are just being braggadocious. Don’t let them rattle your chain. Go ahead with what you were saying. I’m loving all this. Lay it down.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, anyway, my great-grandfather found a crystal, just like that. And it was a perfect emerald disk that had just grown like that naturally in nature. And through that, he was able to see into the plane of thought. And using that, we may have gained a little bit of inspiration for our inventions here in the prime material plane. Kind of cheating, I guess, if you wanna call it that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it possible that through tampering and connecting with these planes, that you might have gotten the attention of something that we shouldn’t have?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[instantly] Definitely not!	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That really kinda feels like what’s going on here.	Magnus
NON-GAME_RELATED			Can you guys give me a minute? Sorry. One sec.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[beeps, then a slamming noise]	stage
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s gotta go write a new story.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s like, “Uh, no no no! Give me twenty minutes!”	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Like when the producers of Lost pretended that it wasn’t about purgatory the whole time.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was?	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was.	Justin and Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was about purgatory? Oh, I thought it was inside like a snowglobe thing and it was, like --	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Here’s the thing, Dad, the tricky thing is even when it wasn’t about purgatory, it was. ‘Cause that’s how purgatory works.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Ahhh.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Hey, I’m back, sorry.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, yeah, my family [sigh], we’ve sort of led the Industrial Revolution in this world for generations now because of that mirror. And so because of that, my mother, Maureen, started to sort of come up with this idea of how we can create other mirrors into other worlds. But it’s really hard to do, you know? Because you can’t, like I said, you can’t cut these gemstones to create these mirrors.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, if it was easy, everyone would do it, you know what I mean?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Exactly! Everybody would have their own extra-planar sort of telescope situation.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Killian’s actually getting a little short-tempered about all this.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She’s like:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you please, just, like, explain what thi- why you use the grand relic to do all this stuff? Cause these are, I don’t- this is cool and everything-	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was trying to grow another mirror for the ethereal plane.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yeah that's what I assumed I just kinda hoping he'd get to the point a little bit.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Read between the lines, Killian!	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, he says	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so,	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, she's not seeing anybody? [Justin: Nice try.] Your mom is not like, dating or anything, right?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yikes, okay no she's-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Maybe Carbon dating?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is she a plant? That's his thing. He nasty.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean my mother was very, very much a botanist she, she sort of helped-	Lucas
NON-CONTENT			Mmhmm.	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did your mom die, or die she like disappear one day?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She passed away, unfortunately.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Passed away into another plaaaane? ?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well yeah, into the astral plane, ‘cause that's where you go. Anyway, I- so I was wor- we- I used the Philosopher’s Stone to transmogrify, uh just pools of water into these different mirrors, uh, it took me some experimenting. I had to, to figure out which gemstones corresponded with which planes. Man, I made so many gemstones. And I uh, yeah the result is I created these 12, I unfortunately was working-	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He flicks another switch on the lectern and the disks just start to sort of rotate around the central one, like they're moving like planets in orbit.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was trying to get their trajectories right, and I accidentally broke the astral mirror, so I gotta grow a new one of those although-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Smooth move Ex-lax!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I very much doubt that you’re gonna let me keep playing around with that Philosopher's Stone, so I guess I'm just gonna have to cut my losses there.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, but then again, I get it when you want the complete set and you don't have it, and you're like one away you know.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, exactly. Anyway-	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Just like NASCAR plates.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m a collector too man, I get it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is what I was working on. This is what I was using the Philosopher’s Stone for. Is to create the cosmoscope which I could use to see the whole planar system, and Merle you asked a very important question earlier that I would also like to circle back to!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah, yes, what was it?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sighs] You’ve already forgotten. Of course, that qu—	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He freezes and time kind of [Travis: Well, you son of a-] time kind of freezes.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Um and,	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You’re in complete control of this world, Griffin! You made that happen! Don’t act like that was out of your control!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, time has kind of frozen here. The orbit of these disks has stopped. Um, and Killian, and Carey and Noelle have just kind of stopped, a- and from behind you, you hear a voice ask that question, uh and it asks-	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s bigger than this?	Red Robe
NON-CONTENT			Oh, yeah!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, god, if he’s got a raincoat on I am not turning around!	Clint
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Snorting laugh]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, like a flasher and his penis!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[Laughing] Thank you, Travis.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			I just want to make sure that all our listeners, especially the younger ones, really understood what dad was implying.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Yeah you know the child- the children who listen to the podcast, [Clint laughing] Daddy!	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Of course.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Children who are going to be very confused the first time they see an onion, like, “I don’t know what these are supposed to be for!”	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			You shouldn't let your kids listen to this show. Griffin literally named a character King Fu**di** (beeped). And it’s like, where does that even fit in, y’know I don’t even. Well I know where it fits in, but-listen I didn’t mean it in the way that you thought I meant it.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I’ll do a recap of what happened before we started talking about dicks.	Griffin

NON-CONTENT			Um. As you-	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I’m lost within myself!	Travis

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I turn around!	Magnus
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That’s fucking, that doesn’t make any sense! Why would he say that right now?	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	[high pitched voice] I turn around too!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	“I’m turning around. We’re all turning!”	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uhm, as you all say that you’re turning around, as you turn around [Justin: out loud], out loud, you see, a floating figure in a bright red robe.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I attack it!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yeah, I blast it with magic missile.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Magnus roll your dice.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Fifteen plus seven, twenty-two!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, he’s incorporeal and your axe passes right through him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I attack again, I get two attacks per turn.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	[background laughter] Fourteen plus seven, Twenty-one!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Your second attack hits!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	It’s a crit!	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	What!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	No, it doesn’t, [Travis: Fuck] he’s incorporeal, it passes right through him.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, and Taako,	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	But does he seem miffed?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Uh-nope!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	Taako, you’re magic missiling him?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	YES	No, I, well it depends, did I know he was incorporeal before, or did I watch him, Travis, attack first? If I watch Magnus attack first, I probably didn’t blast it with Magic Missile.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Okay, uh then-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	I step- Magnus steps into the place that he is, and kind of blends in with him and goes	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, Ho Ho, I’m in a red robe!	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He phases, he phases-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Okay, now I do use magic missile.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He phases sort of upwards so he’s floating above you.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, excuse me…	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh… sup?	Red Robe
NON-CONTENT			No, uh-	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	A/S/L.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	ASMR.	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I spoke to you about the hunger of all living things.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, when was that?	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	recap	NO	The last time he fucking saw you.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Remember a thing! Remember-	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	No that was in character, Griffin. That was Magnus.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Oh.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The last time, in the office building.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In the-? Oh. Oh! With Bane Bane. With Captain Captain Bane.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, he tried to poison you. But I st-	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He tried to poison us?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so a lot of things went unnoticed.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not remembering, that one is by me.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, take it on credit. I warned you about the hunger of all living things.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mmhmm.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He motions to all the different planes, and he says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the power it seeks. The power of creation itself.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Got it.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A billion billion lives have been devoured by this hunger in pursuit of its power.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A billion billion?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yes.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s a lot!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sure is.	Red Robe
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He waves a hand and uh, there is a crate sort of in the back of the room by the lectern.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It actually kind of looks like a, kind of like a trash bin?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as he motions towards it, it tips over and some small gemstone disks crash out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One of them, you can see, is a very dark disk kind of like black. But you can see definitely like flecks of red and green and blue color in this black disk.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	This disk, this disk begins to shake and this horrifying black cloud sort of emerges out of it and it slowly creeps towards these disks that are floating in the room, and one by one, just consumes them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	As each disk is consumed you hear like, screaming voices coming from it.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Woah, hey.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is an absolutely terrifying scene.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	It consumes the prime material plane, and you feel kind of sick watching it. After it has consumed all of them, this red robed figure snaps his fingers [snaps] and the cloud disappears. This vision kind of leaves you. And he says-	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There is no more running, there is no escape. This world is life’s last chance.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Who are you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's not time for me to tell you that yet.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What time will you tell me?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			In like, ten episodes.	Red Robe
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I'll put it in my calendar.	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was totes dead!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was dead though I didn’t [cross talk]	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You just killed-Did we kill him or?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No. Okay, we would have!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was long dead.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No problem, no problem here.	Taako

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And she says-	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, that’s weird,	Noelle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I sense green.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I had my scanner on before, from before when I scanned that crystal monster. It’s uh, I’m picking up- it says it’s. One of you guys isn’t a lich are you?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A what?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A lich.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m not!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, not to my knowledge.	Taako

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Nice.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	 Yeah, uh Merle, between your sort of backgrounds in, uh, religion and arcana, you know that a lich is sort of this embodiment of a, a very powerful magic user, who uh, sort of uh, combines their essence, like life energy with their magical energy, and sort of transcends their physical form. Technically, it’s like an undead- Imagine a ghost made of magic. But, that uh, a magic user has to willfully do that.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Although-	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Like David Blaine!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Kind of, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Except what’s interesting is, is that most liches, when a magic user does this, it’s like way too ambitious a thing, and they can’t really control that energy. Most liches are just like, insane. Like they have no control over themselves. They’re just hyper, hyper-violent, hyper-evil embodiments of like, raw magical energy. They are not usually well-spoken beings.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas also says-	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well that’s weird, did one of you knock over my rubbish bin? I had some things here I was uh, these were some mirrors that didn’t end up being anything. Um. Did one of you guys, like, come over and kick this over? [Cross talk]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, That does sound like us but, no…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No! Uh-uh!	Merle

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh that’s easy.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I’ll just talk like I always talk, cause I don’t, that means I don’t have to do character voices like you guys, [Griffin laughing] or dad, ever.	Justin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I do!	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	And I chop his arm off!	Clint

That like inhabited golems that we’ve been fighting and that kind of stuff, that sang to us about seeing beyond the plane, and their crystal kingdom? It really feels like this planar stuff, might have something to do with that.	Magnus

Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then another wave, and it is just shimmering orange topaz. And the room just keeps like, fluctuating quickly between these different colours and it kind of feels like there's an earthquake happening as the entire lab transmutates between these different gemstones.

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Merle, you see your arm, your poor, poor crystallised arm sort of float into this mass and come together to form another crystal golem.

Magnus, you have control of like your head, you can talk and do stuff, and you have control of your hands, but you can’t really move - move your arms or legs. You’re supine. Taako, you are just totally down for the count. And it looks like Carey and Killian are as well. And the crystal golem, seeing you in this sad state has said:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well this is gonna be a lot easier than I thought.	Crystal Golem
NON-GAME_RELATED			Man it’s gonna be weird doing these accents with you right in my grill.	Griffin

MECHANICS		YES	You should be at 19 right now, when you get healed, when you’re below zero, then you -- hey, when you took that big hit from the big crystal bomb, you didn’t go to half your max health underneath it, right? Like if your max health is 40, you didn’t go to negative 20?	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	No.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	Okay good, cause that’s an instant death.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Here’s what I’m going to do in actuality.	Travis

And, for his attack, he is going to take another stab at Merle.	Griffin

NON-CONTENT			Yeah, okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Alright, we’ll say you fucking, like, slump your dead left arm over and throw the Shield of Memories, uh, to like sort of block the first attack as the second one comes in… [dice roll] and is a fuckin’ two which is not going to hit, with modifier. So yes, his first attack looked incredibly powerful, but the shield as you sort of dropped it to the floor deflects it away and his second one misses heartily. And he goes,	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Yes. Yes.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Alright.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Yeah, you plug it into this fist sized floating crystal in the air and as you do, it--your fork slides in as though you are piercing a bread roll. As you do actually you realize this particular piece of crystal is actually part of Merle’s former arm.	Griffin

Like, there’s some sort of sweet element, like a brown sugar, maybe, in the butter? But it feels, it’s actually - it’s weird because, like, it wasn’t cooked, you magically transformed it into some sort of edible material-- It should just be like a meal ready to eat, but actually it’s soft, like it just came out of the oven?

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Killian feels the back of her helmet and says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god. This is—I’m—I—oh my god. This is the most frustrating thing that’s ever happened. All I’ve wanted in life up to this point is to find Lucas and destroy him. And I don’t think it’s safe for me to go on much further with this—with this here crack in my helmet.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you wanna swap helmets?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, that seems like—I, your sweet head can’t get crystallized either! Dumb-dumb!	Killian

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s a really sweet offer, Magnus, but—and it is technically your fault because, like, we were just about to bust this perp when you…	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeeaaaaah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			… when you started kibitzing. Um, but I… I gotta be honest with you guys, I don’t think it’s that smart for me to get close to the relic to begin with.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, that’s not your job, right? That’s like our job.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I mean it’s up to you guys to recover that stuff and I, um… I haven’t really told you guys this, but you remember when we met and we recovered that gauntlet together?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I really wanted to grab it and take it and put it on? And get fire p- fire powers. Like I really…	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I gotcha.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s—	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know how to describe this. I was like, when you guys ran up and grabbed that thing, I was like, ooh, I kinda wanted to like, kill you? And have it? For me?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does that make sense?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, we all—	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Totally.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We all wanted that. We just didn’t. We rose above and that’s the important thing, you’ve proven yourself…	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, but I was about to definitely not rise above. Does that make sense? [crosstalk] Like, I was like… I was like, I have…	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] You just ran out of time? You got distracted or somethin’? I’ve been there.	Taako
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			Clint: [snorting]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah. So, I really… I don’t think it’s that good of a call for me to get in there and grab it.	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How about this? How about a new job for you.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You and Noelle get the bugbears outta here to safety.	Magnus
NON-CONTENT			Uh, jeez, okay. Noelle,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If it’s okay—I’d—I’d kinda like to... I’d kinda like to see this through. I can tell you how to get ‘em out, though, we should be able to, um, figure out a path through the lab to extract you that’s not crystallized. But I need to… there’s somethin’ I need to figure out, um. So I—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it math?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I know all math, I'm a robot, so…	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can just like, punch that into my Windows, sort of my MS-DOS calculator brain. But yeah, um, I’d like to stick with you guys if that’s alright.	Noelle

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	… a little map of the lab and then she pops out a little highlighter attachment from her frame and doodles on it for a bit and Killian takes it and says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I'm gonna—I guess I'm gonna head out. Carey, be careful. Just get these guys to the—to the finish line, don’t you know, don’t be a hero. And I’ll see you guys back—	Killian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, Carey, if you wanna be a hero, I mean—we could use at least one. Right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wouldn’t say no.	Magnus
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[singing] Carey, don’t be a hero!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Killian walks back out through the door back, back towards the bugbear encampment and is gone. And, uh, Carey walks over and presses the button to summon the elevator back in the middle of the room. And she says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ugh, I feel, um, I feel considerably less good about our chances now, if I'm being completely honest. But, uh, let’s do our best out there, guys, huh?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, we didn’t ask, but thanks, Debbie Downer.	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	When the elevator that Lucas went down shows up and the doors part, there is a metal grate, a heavy metal grate, now covering the door as it opens. And it—there doesn’t seem to be any sort of discernable clasp on it, there doesn’t seem to be any discernible, like, handle? To open it up? There’s just this heavy metal grate now covering the elevator down to the lower levels.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I guess we should just turn back and go home, mission failed, right guys?	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, we did our best!	Carey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey, we did our best, no harm in that! All you can do is your best!	Carey

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You hear a sound come from the elevator, though. From above you, actually. And then you hear—and you see the elevator sort of shake violently as you hear what I can only describe as a smashing sound come from above.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And that’s—as more smashes happen, you see that the source of this violent elevator car assault is coming from a bright yellow—what looks like another elevator car.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it is smashing it down and crushing it like a tin can and pretty soon, this locked-off elevator car just falls and replacing it, you see, now appearing in front of you, a bright yellow elevator car with a big, bright red nose, and two big white eyes…	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The lab, you noticed when you were outside of it, has kind of a conical shape to it so it’s bigger on top than it is down below, kind of a Cloud City, Bespin thing going on?

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well that leads to the robotics manufacturing center.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That one, please.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			All of the—oh, are you sure? All of the rooms on this floor are sorta networked by this robot delivery system, so robots, as Lucas and anybody in the lab needs ‘em, those robots are gonna be put together in the manufacturing center, and then we have like a conveyor networking system that delivers those bespoke ‘bots to wherever you need ‘em.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That sounds like a fun room.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I mean it’s pretty cool. It’s like my—for me it was like my nursery, you know?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What do you think, Garyl?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ll be honest, I don’t know what you’re tryin’ to achieve. I mean the robot room sounds– cool, to me, but the other thing, who’s the—Lucas? Do you hate him and wanna kill him, what’s the story there? I legitimately don’t know what you’re trying to achieve.	Garyl
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, you know, it’d take too long to explain it. ‘Cause I don’t remember.	Magnus

This place is as messy—it’s as messy as Lucas’s private quarters. Yeah, so there’s a bunch of these scrapped robots all over, just all piled up. What you notice about some of the robots, some of the more sophisticated looking ones, is they have little windows in their torsos. And inside those little windows you can see what looks like a big, glass fuse kinda similar to the one that Noelle has in the middle of her chassis behind another window.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Noelle’s just kinda, like, lookin’ at these robots with these fuses in their chests and is kinda like, movin’ em around with her arm and just kinda looking ‘em over.	Griffin

MECHANICS		NO	Sixteen for me.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I did not do great.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, the only thing you can kinda put together, Taako, is that not all of these robots have these little fuses built into them and the ones that do have more sort of vaguely humanoid appearances? To sort of compare them, the ones that you see all laying around with the fuses, as compared to Noelle, like, Noelle, like I said earlier’s kinda like rough-shod, she’s kinda put together of all these different component parts, constituent parts. A lot of these robots are kind of approaching a sort of human look to them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	And you can kinda put together that, like, if anything, Noelle was sort of a prototype to whatever these are.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Hmm.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled a 2.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Okay, you—Noelle is a robot.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Got it.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Can—	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			Justin: [laughing]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Can—maybe—can we maybe take some of those fuses?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re actually like, embedded in the torsos of most of these things so you’d have to take, like, the whole thing and it would be.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It would be pretty, um, cumbersome.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey—hey, Noelle, I noticed that you have a sort of fuse-looking thing, similar to some of these other robots.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s—what’s that all about?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, it’s just one of my power units. I don’t really—I don’t actually—I don’t actually know that much about my own sorta, y’know, my own sorta machinery, but, um, yeah. Lucas has always just told me that it’s just another power source inside of me, so. Um, we should, guys, we should really get a move on—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, wait, wait.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			—we don’t have that long.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle? Noelle? Look at me. Look at me, Noelle.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah? I'm lookin’.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re better than any of these damn junky robots.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I'm the only one floatin’, I guess. Yeah, alright.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right! So don’t be lookin’ at them and gettin’ sad!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, well—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You are my special angel.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, thanks.	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus goes through the door on Garyl.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Garyl, onward!	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you move into the tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s actually dark as fuck in here, there’s, like, no lighting whatsoever. And this conveyor belt is not running, there’s, like, nothing running in this room, it’s—it’s— quiet.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you go through, Noelle actually powers on a little flashlight in her body and is helping you all look around.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What color is it?	Clint
NON-CONTENT			Uhh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Lavender.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You really caught me off-guard with that.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I know. But you recovered nicely.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And yeah, she’s walking you through this tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s still quiet, although you hear what sounds like sort of a low-pitched wind coming from in front of you as you move down this tunnel.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[wind blowing]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, I should be able to get us there, there’s a few twists and turns we need to make, but, um. Shouldn’t be too complicated.	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And—almost as soon as she says that, you see a light in front of you.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[ominous electric machinery noises]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What looks like a floating ball of light in front of you that appears from around a corner. And then you see a second, and then a third ball of light. You see three floating balls of light and they fly at you fast.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But they don’t collide with you, they just kinda pass over and around you and as they do, you hear what sounds like, this sound of like, men, like, moaning sadly as they—as they fly by you. And move through the tunnel back into the robot factory.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, snap! I might’ve just figured out what those fuses are for.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	From behind you, where the lights went, you see three shapes appear in the tunnel behind you. And they are three humanoid robots. One is sort of massive, massively built, kind of gorilla-like. Another is much more slender with a, what looks like a cannon for an arm. And another one is very short and has what appears to be, like, a bunch of wires sticking out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And they all run at you and once they get within sort of spitting distance, they stop and you hear all three kind of laugh. And one of them goes,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god, I can’t believe it’s you guys! Oh my god, I can’t believe I get a second stab at this!	Maarvey
NON-CONTENT			Uh,	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Huh?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	That’s the one, the big gorilla-lookin’ one says that. And the one with the cannon for an arm goes:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yes! This is going to be a lovely little rematch, isn’t it?	Magic Brian
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh snap, Magic Brian!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the short one with the wires sticking out of it says, uh:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right, motherfuckers. It’s time for round 2.	Jenkins
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I said I'd smell you later.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Consider yourselves	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Smelled!	Clint & Justin
