IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you made it to The Magical World of Elevators, huh?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus, Merle, & Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s, uh--well, this lab has been in my family for a few generations.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--I inherited it from my--from my mom, um, but there was a codicil in the will that required that I keep this museum, uh, honoring my grandpa’s greatest technological accomplishment, intact.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He--he invented the elevator.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And honestly, like, most of the technological, uh, advancements in our world.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was all--that was all Grandpa Roman.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, um, yeah, I couldn’t change it, but go ahead and have a look around.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s--I think you might learn a little bit of something about elevators.	Lucas	0

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it hard feeling like you’re always in his shadow?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does it--	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ooh, good question.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you feel like you’re in Roman’s shadow?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, a little bit, sometimes, like--	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m trying to make my own mark on the world, and frankly, I feel like a lot of his inventions were kind of primitive, and people just aren’t as excited about inventions.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, when the first elevator came out, forget about it.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you try and invent a new, better elevator, and people don’t wanna hear any of it.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s an up and down business.	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			People say that about, um, Thomas Edison a lot.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, he invented the lightbulb, but--right?--but, like, they didn’t have them back then, right?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if I had been around back then, that would have been easy for me, ‘cause they didn’t have lightbulbs.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They didn’t have anything.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, like, inventing stuff was way easier.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			These days, I’d have to invent, like, a double lightbulb or something to even get that kind of impact.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Holy--just--wait--pau--hold on for a second.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I gotta write that down.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double light bulb.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double…	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can have that one, that’s fine.	Taako	0

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I gotta say, the timing on this episode’s a little bit off, ‘cause I think we’re at the end of it now, and, man, it would’ve been cool if it had ended with Della Reese stabbing a crystal monster to death and not the three of you entering a museum and then, like, having a talk with some guy about his grandpa.

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The Philosopher’s Stone is just a very powerful, um, sort of cypher for transmutation magic.	Angus	0

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like these are like oddly human-ous names.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] -Yeah sure-- we’ve got our original names-- we have our bugbear names-- but we choose not to, sorta, remember that part of our lives ‘cause it was pretty... we used to do some pretty bad stuff out there out in the wild.	Aaron	0

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bugbears.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tell us about this other group you encountered before us.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Aw, yeah, they were really rude!	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They came through, and we offered them, y’know, some tea, and we just... y’know, we asked how they were doin’ and they wanted to get by, and head inward-- towards the inner chambers in the lab.	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we’re like, we can’t let that happen, of course, so we had sort of a disagreement--	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, pardon?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, sorry?	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We, um... totally gotcha, why- why can you not let-- hypothetically, a group of people pass by to get in?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, well that’s, like, sort of our thing, y’know-- we do our jobs around the place, but we’re also... we are still bugbears.	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, so we’re like, really big, so we also do some light security work, um, for the lab as well.	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Y’know, we can’t really let folks--	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, what if Lucas said it was cool?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess that would be fine?	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He-- he didn’t tell us it was cool with this last group though, so uh--	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I…  [crosstalk]	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was sort of a kerfuffle?	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was a lil’ dwarf guy that attacked us, so we gave him a lil’-- a lil’ piece of our minds, there was a lizard lady, and she threw some sort of smoke bomb at us-- and we all went to dreamy-dream town.	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They sound like dicks.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[mumbled agreement from Merle]	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I hated ‘em.	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you hear me?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come in, Lucas--	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, okay, I guess you’ve sorta found out about one of my less ethical sort of experiments.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sounds fine.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They seem great.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Yeah, they’re really sweethearts.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, they really are-- they’re great-- they have these, um-- these inhibitors-- these inhibitor chips, in their brains, that I...	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was trying to come up with a way to like, have people that would do some help for me around the lab.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Ohhhh.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But also protect the lab from attackers, so I…	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Slavery, right?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, [sighs] I guess, kind of, yeah a little bit, but they-- I mean, they seem genuinely happy, and y’know, they didn’t like being... all violent--	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] So this is why we couldn’t charm Klaarg again.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I saw, I watched what you guys did with Klaarg-- when I watched you on the races, and when I saw him pop up, I was a little bit surprised-- I gotta know, what did you guys do to him down there?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slowly] We charmed him.	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s our buddy.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You used, like a charm spell on him?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Klaarg, or as he was known here, Daniel Butler-- he was my butler-- he, um--	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, you gotta get better at that.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C’mon.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A little subtlety.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Aw, no, I thought it was-- I thought it was cute.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, um, he ran off-- he got into a little scuffle with his sister, and he bumped his head, and I think it disabled the inhibitor chip, and he had a freak-out.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he-- he ran off and escaped, and all I can think is that when you charmed him, somehow the wires got crossed in his brain?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As it turns out, if you, like, inhibit all the aggression in a bugbear, they’re actually very sweet.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, and so I that think he’s a bit on the fritz, Taako.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, right!	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, okay, now I remember-- I charmed him the first time we met him, to turn him into like, Kelsey Grammer?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mhm.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think the odds are actually pretty good that he’s, maybe gonna be charmed by you forever, kind of like... on and off.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool!	Magnus	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He can join a nation of podcast listeners, [laughter] in that particular affliction.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, so, Luco-- need you to pass on to these, uh... these hugbears, that it’s totally cool for us to continue on our way unmolested.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah sure, uh, hey guys, you just gotta let ‘em pass, okay?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re trying to get in-- into the middle.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we go, will you tell us just just a little bit more about the scuffle?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was there a problem with the scuffle?	Merle	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, like, we were-- we don’t wanna be rude, we try to be real nice here, as-- as much as we can, but yeah these-- these three, um.	Jamie	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Honestly it was just the dwarf guy that was mostly sorta causin’ all the trouble, honestly reminds me of back in my day, um, one time a guy came into my cave and I just killed ‘em!	Jamie	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’ve all been there.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I definitely killed some guys who came into my cave, too.	John	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just feel like if that happens, you throw ‘em right off a cliff?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it’s usually fine.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, I’ve thrown plenty of people off cliffs,	Jamie	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Several “yeah”s]	stage	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s uh, cliff-throwing is what bugbears do best, really.	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We should compare notes-- so we need to keep on movin’.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s all about the angle.	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The angle --	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think it’s about the dangle, but that’s just me.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I guess I-- I guess we can let you through, if Lucas has vouched for ya.	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So can ya tell me what’s goin’ on in this lab?	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			‘Cause I’ve heard lots of crinkle-tinkles--	Aaron	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, you guys need to get movin’.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh...	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, this is not a cool scene, you need to move on out.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, do you wanna come with us?	Magnus	0

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s fine.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] I’m fine.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should just do that, though.	Magnus	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle says, um,	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, hold on, it might be kinda dangerous ‘cause it’s all crystallized out there.	Noelle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s why I’m saying they should come with us, ‘cause they can’t go out that way, they have to keep moving inward.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but there could be other parts of it-- why don’t you-- I’ll tell you what, you four just lock yourselves in the airlock when we leave.	Noelle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ll be safe in there, until we, we can come get ya.	Noelle	0

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you make your way into the door that you saw earlier that was labeled 'The Cosmoscope.'	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you pass through the airlock into the Cosmoscope you enter into what you assume to be a pretty large chamber, although it is like, completely pitch black in here.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Save for a pillar of light which is illuminating what looks like a circular disk that is kind of free-floating in the middle of the room, facing you.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And uh, Lucas walks into the back of the room, into the darkness.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see him get out a flashlight and you can see he's messing with some sort of lectern back there…	Griffin	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Time for scary stories!	Travis	0

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the tale of the... [stalling] old... sailor's... mummy!	Lucas	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, he flips some switches on this lectern and you see an image pop up on this disk, and it looks like the lab that you are currently standing in, as seen from above, from outside of the lab.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says,	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I’m about to get into some pretty heavy concepts.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, I’m probably going to blow your whole mind and just kinda reshape the way you think about existence and stuff.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if it ever gets to be too much or you have any questions, please feel free to stop me, okay?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay wait stop: you’re blowing my mind.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boy, this is gonna take forever, I bet.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s take this slow.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My whole life, I have been obsessed with the concepts of taxonomy and hierarchy.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For everything that exists, there’s always a bigger thing that contains it.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s always someone cooler than you, right?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s one way of putting it, yeah.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So there’s always a bigger thing that has a bigger thing that contains it, and so on and so forth, repeated on to just inconceivable degrees.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way up.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bigger turtles.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So…	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he points to this disk in the middle of the room, and he says:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so this is my lab.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We can go way deeper on, like, the micro scale.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			To, like, elementary particles and stuff like that.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But for the lightweight version of this demonstration, let’s start here.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s my lab.	Lucas	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Got it.	Travis	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he holds up two index fingers, and does, like, an iPhone pinch-- pinches them together, and the image pans out.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see it zoom out, and now you can see the Stillwater Sea underneath his lab.	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so here it is floating over the Stillwater Sea --	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he pinches the screen again.	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s that sea in relation to the neighboring landmasses, and here’s the whole continent, Faerûn.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s our whole world, Abeir-Toril.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How’d you do that?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just bear with me.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re gonna go way way further.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: What?]	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s our solar system.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: Huh??]	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s the local interstellar cloud, [Magnus: What?]	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			the local bubble, the local arm, the galaxy…	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as he’s doing this, you’re seeing the entire galaxy, spiraling.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s beautiful.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You’ve never seen anything quite like it.	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s the local group -- [Magnus: I’ve seen it.]	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Oh.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Laughs] Okay.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I wanna actually ask you guys about that here in a minute, but here’s the local group, the local cluster, the local supercluster, and so on and so forth, until… Here!	Lucas	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s all just a collar on a cat!	Travis	1
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the observable universe.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is everything we know, every place we’ve ever been, every person we’ve ever met, every place anyone’s ever been, is in here.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But more importantly, so are the immutable rules that govern the people, places and things inside of this universe.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Things like gravity and thermodynamics and arcane interactions.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And all that stuff, all that matter and energy and the rules that govern it, comprise this.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Our universe.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys are just a handful of people who have ever seen the observable universe before, so.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty cool, right?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk]	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, is there like a guest book we need to sign, or...?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Deep voice] Hey, listen, uh, listen.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What if I was to take one step past what you’ve shown me here?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, can I say something?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s up?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve just made me very, very happy.	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He walks to the back of the room-	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And also, just to clarify, horny.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk]	Taako	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It all ties together.	Clint	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			- and also, you have a deep desire to give me a lot of money.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve made me very horny.	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	–he says, and he flips a switch on that lectern, and the whole room lights up.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the disk in the middle that you were just looking at is made of some sort of dark, bluish-green material, in a perfect circle with some silvery trim all around it, and this disk is levitating.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you realize, as the lights go up, this room is filled with these disks.	Griffin	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC: The Cosmoscope starts]	stage	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they’re all arrayed in orbit around this central disk in rings around it.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s ten other of these disks in the room and they’re all different colors -- bright reds and oranges and greens and blues and whites -- and they’re all displaying a wide array of scenes of impossible things.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You look into this red disk, [Magnus: Like what?]	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	you see a world that looks kind of like the world, if the world was made completely out of lava and fire.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then there’s a blue disk where it’s just a giant ocean, a world made of water and ice.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where millions and millions of these living lights just float weightlessly through the air and worlds where oceans of magical energy wash up on shores made of these brilliant white sands--	Griffin	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	There’s a name for that one.	Justin	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s Ibiza.	Justin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see-	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where everything's the same except everybody's got mustaches…	Travis	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	You see, well, no, that’s not one of them, but you see all of these, like, incredible worlds and you don’t know where to look--	Griffin	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Uh, I would.	Justin	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I would look at Buffet Planet back there, couple planets back.	Justin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, to answer your question, this is the next thing that’s bigger.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is our planar system.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, this, this disk, that you see, that represents our observable universe, this is actually our plane.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the prime material plane.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re smack-dab in the middle of the planar universe.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And each of these are different planes of existence, and they, they each produce unique energies and they share these energies.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They inform the material and physical make-up of, of, of each other.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They each have connections, some are more tenuous than others.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But these make up the real existence, uh -- each plane having its own sort of energies and rules.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, this is what’s bigger than the universe.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then what’s bigger than that?	Merle	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Good question.	Travis	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Thank you.	Clint	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, let’s start with this: There are six building block planes, right?	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And these, he points to these disks that are on the outermost ring away from the prime material plane disk that’s in the middle of the room.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he goes:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So you’ve got your elemental planes: Fire, air, water, earth.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then you got the planes of light and shadow.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: Heart?]	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, certainly, you probably know a little bit about these during your studies at Wizard U.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low and raspy voice] Yeah, I’ve gotten balls-deep in some of those other planes.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think he’s got a secret room in one of ‘em.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When I use Blink, I get all up in those other planes.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s right.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When you use Blink, you end up in the ethereal plane.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn’t list that amongst your planes.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, there’s more.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m gonna run through them.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But if you actually look --	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can actually see underneath the disk that you were looking at first, where you’re looking at your own universe, you actually see another disk underneath it.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s like:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That one is the ethereal plane, and it’s kind of like a filter.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like where the raw energies of the rest of the planes are kinda filtered into the prime material plane so it’s not just like, everything’s on fire or drowning all the time.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So yeah, anyway, that’s the seventh, and then we got the planes that sort of inform the energies of life itself, like the plane of magic where magic energy is born.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then on the opposite end of that, you see there’s the plane of thought which is the source of logic and reason and emotion.	Lucas	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So the boring one.	Travis	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, as you actually look into the plane of thought, which is this deep green emerald mirror, you see similar scenes to the things that you saw in the compact, Magnus.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a large, wide, gray road with a bunch of vehicles just sort of sitting stuck on it.	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Metal dragons!	Magnus	1
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see scenes like you saw in the compact.	Griffin	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So this plane is where all the creativity and energy for this world comes from.	Travis	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	The creation.	Travis	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like where the home of logical thought is.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s why I call it the plane of thought.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Show me Donald Trump!	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t... know quite who that is.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Although, the fact that you guys make so many references to this world makes me think you have to have spent some time there at some point.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a little house there.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t tell if you’re joking, which is like, kinda par for the course.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, there’s the other higher planes, there’s the celestial plane, which is inhabited by the beings that I guess some people would consider deities.	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s the meat plane, the vegetable plane, the dairy plane, the breads plane…	Clint	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Soluble fats plane…	Justin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but you only wanna visit that one sometimes!	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plain plane, that's not very exciting.	Travis	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plane plane, that's just full of planes.	Justin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the plain plane plane with all these plain planes in the plane.	Clint	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, you gotta be careful with that one.	Travis	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been working on a new version of the food pyramid, to kinda educate the people of Faerûn, but it’s kinda like a cube?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it’s for people who like to party.	Lucas	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, hey, listen, I gotta be honest.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			From me to you, that sounds dope as hell.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[continuing from before the comedic tangent] And then the prime material plane, the ethereal plane, you know about those.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then the astral plane, which is where our unconscious forms -- our souls -- retire when we die here in the prime material plane.	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is Merle’s arm there?	Travis	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute!	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute!	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That goes completely against my theology.	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is there a Pan plane?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please respect his beliefs.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, Pan probably kicks it in the celestial plane.	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Actually, as he was talking about the astral plane, you realize he’s talked about 12 different planes but there are only 11 in the room.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The astral plane -- so anyway, let me explain.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Crystals, certain types of gemstones, if grown into a perfect circle -- they can’t be cut!	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If you cut it, it doesn’t work.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They have to be naturally grown in a perfect circle -- resonate with the different planes of existence.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			With the twelve planes that form our planar system, right?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, everybody knows that.	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s 101.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Literally nobody outside this family knows that, until now.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I knew it.	Merle	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We talked about it yesterday.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You remember that, Merle?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Frustrated] Yeah, okay, so-	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, when I wasn’t speaking to you.	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[lower voice] Hey, listen, little man, these guys are just being braggadocious.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t let them rattle your chain.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Go ahead with what you were saying.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m loving all this.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lay it down.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, anyway, my great-grandfather found a crystal, just like that.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it was a perfect emerald disk that had just grown like that naturally in nature.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And through that, he was able to see into the plane of thought.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And using that, we may have gained a little bit of inspiration for our inventions here in the prime material plane.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Kind of cheating, I guess, if you wanna call it that.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it possible that through tampering and connecting with these planes, that you might have gotten the attention of something that we shouldn’t have?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[instantly] Definitely not!	Lucas	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That really kinda feels like what’s going on here.	Magnus	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Can you guys give me a minute?	Griffin	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Sorry.	Griffin	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			One sec.	Griffin	0
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[beeps, then a slamming noise]	stage	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s gotta go write a new story.	Justin	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s like, “Uh, no no no!	Travis	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Give me twenty minutes!”	Travis	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Like when the producers of Lost pretended that it wasn’t about purgatory the whole time.	Justin	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was?	Clint	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was.	Justin and Travis	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was about purgatory?	Clint	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Oh, I thought it was inside like a snowglobe thing and it was, like --	Clint	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Here’s the thing, Dad, the tricky thing is even when it wasn’t about purgatory, it was.	Travis	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			‘Cause that’s how purgatory works.	Travis	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Ahhh.	Clint	0
NON-GAME_RELATED			Hey, I’m back, sorry.	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, yeah, my family [sigh], we’ve sort of led the Industrial Revolution in this world for generations now because of that mirror.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And so because of that, my mother, Maureen, started to sort of come up with this idea of how we can create other mirrors into other worlds.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it’s really hard to do, you know?	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because you can’t, like I said, you can’t cut these gemstones to create these mirrors.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, if it was easy, everyone would do it, you know what I mean?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Exactly!	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Everybody would have their own extra-planar sort of telescope situation.	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Killian’s actually getting a little short-tempered about all this.	Griffin	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She’s like:	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you please, just, like, explain what thi- why you use the grand relic to do all this stuff?	Killian	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cause these are, I don’t- this is cool and everything-	Killian	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He was trying to grow another mirror for the ethereal plane.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yeah that's what I assumed I just kinda hoping he'd get to the point a little bit.	Killian	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Read between the lines, Killian!	Magnus	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Uh, he says	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so,	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, she's not seeing anybody?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Justin: Nice try.]	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Your mom is not like, dating or anything, right?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yikes, okay no she's-	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Maybe Carbon dating?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is she a plant?	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's his thing.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He nasty.	Taako	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean my mother was very, very much a botanist she, she sort of helped-	Lucas	1
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did your mom die, or die she like disappear one day?	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			She passed away, unfortunately.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Passed away into another plaaaane?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well yeah, into the astral plane, ‘cause that's where you go.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, I- so I was wor- we- I used the Philosopher’s Stone to transmogrify, uh just pools of water into these different mirrors, uh, it took me some experimenting.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I had to, to figure out which gemstones corresponded with which planes.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Man, I made so many gemstones.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And I uh, yeah the result is I created these 12, I unfortunately was working-	Lucas	0
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He flicks another switch on the lectern and the disks just start to sort of rotate around the central one, like they're moving like planets in orbit.	Griffin	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was trying to get their trajectories right, and I accidentally broke the astral mirror, so I gotta grow a new one of those although-	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Smooth move Ex-lax!	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I very much doubt that you’re gonna let me keep playing around with that Philosopher's Stone, so I guess I'm just gonna have to cut my losses there.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, but then again, I get it when you want the complete set and you don't have it, and you're like one away you know.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, exactly.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway-	Lucas	0
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Just like NASCAR plates.	Clint	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m a collector too man, I get it.	Magnus	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is what I was working on.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is what I was using the Philosopher’s Stone for.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is to create the cosmoscope which I could use to see the whole planar system, and Merle you asked a very important question earlier that I would also like to circle back to!	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ah, yes, what was it?	Merle	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[sighs] You’ve already forgotten.	Lucas	0
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Of course, that qu—	Lucas	0

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, it does not do very much, again, because of his Stoneskin, but it is enough to make Maarvey-bot give up the ghost, quite literally, as the fuse in his chest explodes and the three ghosts come flying out of him.	Griffin	0
