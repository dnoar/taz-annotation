IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hell yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just put your hand on the panel, and I’ll channel enough energy into it and let you guys through, and then once you move through that chamber, I’ll be able to shut down that airlock and buy us a little bit more energy and a little bit more time.	Lucas

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you live in the pendant?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He is independent.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, that’s a good joke.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, just put your hand on the panel on the door and it should open up for you, and-- and, um, you’ll-- you’ll-- you’ll be protected, um, from the, uh, from that crystal thing.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You should be-- the next chamber should be clear as far as I know.	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s actually two hatches.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It, uh, it branches off, forming sort of a Y junction.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and hanging in between those two hatches is, a, uh, a sign, and it is noting which is in either direction.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And you hear Lucas say:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now you should be at a--a--a branch in the path, um, and-- and I’ll be able to buy us a little bit more time.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re at about-- oh, we’re running real low, guys.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re at about ten minutes before this thing h-hits the water, um, so whichever one you go in, I’ll be able to disable the airlock on the other side and-and buy us a bit more time by giving me more energy to channel, uh, into the core.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, so--so pick a side, and I’ll just, uh, I’ll--after you go through, I’ll shut down the other one.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What are the two sides?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, to the left, you see a sign over the hatch that says, “Research Materials Storage Chamber,” and then, on the right, you see a sign that says, “The Magical World of Elevators.”	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Really?	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Griffin--	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	That’s what it says.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Griffin’s really sticking it to the people who say he’s not allowed to have elevators in this game.	Justin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[Clint cackles]	stage
NON-CONTENT			Um--	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Again, it’s the Research Materials Storage Chamber, or the Magical World of Elevators.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This one’s easy.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s elevators.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s go.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here we go!	Merle
NON-CONTENT			Uh, okay.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You walk forward and open up this next hatch, and it spins open to… a beautiful, ornate room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, a fairly large chamber that almost sort of resembles, like, a museum with these different exhibits lining both sides of this long chamber.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And inside of each exhibit, in little brass and wood display cases, you see different elevators.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Um, and you hear Lucas chime in and say, like:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, you made it to The Magical World of Elevators, huh?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus, Merle, & Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s, uh--well, this lab has been in my family for a few generations.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I--I inherited it from my--from my mom, um, but there was a codicil in the will that required that I keep this museum, uh, honoring my grandpa’s greatest technological accomplishment, intact.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He--he invented the elevator.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And honestly, like, most of the technological, uh, advancements in our world.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That was all--that was all Grandpa Roman.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, um, yeah, I couldn’t change it, but go ahead and have a look around.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s--I think you might learn a little bit of something about elevators.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t we have, like, shit to do?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it hard feeling like you’re always in his shadow?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Does it--	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Ooh, good question.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Do you feel like you’re in Roman’s shadow?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, a little bit, sometimes, like--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m trying to make my own mark on the world, and frankly, I feel like a lot of his inventions were kind of primitive, and people just aren’t as excited about inventions.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, when the first elevator came out, forget about it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you try and invent a new, better elevator, and people don’t wanna hear any of it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s an up and down business.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			People say that about, um, Thomas Edison a lot.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like, he invented the lightbulb, but--right?--but, like, they didn’t have them back then, right?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if I had been around back then, that would have been easy for me, ‘cause they didn’t have lightbulbs.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They didn’t have anything.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, like, inventing stuff was way easier.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			These days, I’d have to invent, like, a double lightbulb or something to even get that kind of impact.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Holy--just--wait--pau--hold on for a second.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I gotta write that down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double light bulb.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Double…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You can have that one, that’s fine.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Light bulb…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, don’t give it to him!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, money's no object to me.	Taako

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think we’ve all--let’s go home and think about what we’ve learned.	Magnus
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I gotta say, the timing on this episode’s a little bit off, ‘cause I think we’re at the end of it now, and, man, it would’ve been cool if it had ended with Della Reese stabbing a crystal monster to death and not the three of you entering a museum and then, like, having a talk with some guy about his grandpa.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it was like—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that shouldn’t, that definitely shouldn’t happen.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The Philosopher’s Stone is just a very powerful, um, sort of cypher for transmutation magic.	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it allows you to change really any material into any other material, but it shouldn’t be able to animate material!	Angus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because I mean, that, that’s just beyond its capabilities!	Angus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like we didn’t really go up or— Like it’s not like, this didn’t get us to a different floor so it’s a pretty shitty elevator, really.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, it’s all semantics don’t you think?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it was more of like The Shrink Machine Into a Version of Neverwinter of Tomorrow.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well you did go down technically speaking—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean yeah, but it didn’t really elevate us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Okay, but imagine, what if we could build a tower that could get smaller as you go up, so you can shrink in size and adjust your own size as you go up wouldn’t that be neat?	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s just a big, heavy block of metal.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Imagine - if you’re - to give you a more robot-centric point of reference, more Conky-shaped than an Alan Tudyk-bot from “I, Robot.”	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Does it have arms, legs?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It does!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And again, it looks like it was made out of parts from other robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	So it has this big, hulkin’ central core with these vents and ports that don’t actually look like they’re in use.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One of its arms looks vaguely...humanoid-shaped, like it’s got five fingers and a hand, but the metal doesn’t actually match the rest of the metal of its frame?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It looks like it’s cast from bronze.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The other arm is like a foot longer than the humanoid-esque arm, but it doesn’t have a hand at the end of it, it just kinda has a hole at the end of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s got these four small turbines that are giving off a faint blue light that are somehow keeping this thing levitating a few feet off the ground.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It does not have legs, it’s just kinda floating through the air.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s a window in the center of its central frame, and inside - through that window, you can see what appears to be a pretty large glass cylindrical fuse, which illuminates whenever this thing talks!	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see two men sitting on a pretty comfortable-looking sofa with a big pitbull splayed out on top of them, and they’re looking at this flashing, illuminated box on the other side of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then suddenly the image changes and you’re looking at sort of an older woman who’s sitting in the driver's seat of some sort of vehicle and she’s listening to the smoothest jazz in a line of other vehicles in front of a building with a sign with a big burger on top of it.	Griffin

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Um, as you pop open the room labelled “hugbears”, you, uh, enter into a pretty curious scene, and it’s unlike any room you’ve been on in Lucas’s lab so far.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s actually a pretty cosy-looking living room.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I just went with-- I just kept my original name.	Christy
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My bugbear name.	Christy
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC FADES]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is this like a Jellicle Cats kind of situation, where these are the names Lucas gave you, but you have your own names for each other?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Like these are like oddly human-ous names.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] -Yeah sure-- we’ve got our original names-- we have our bugbear names-- but we choose not to, sorta, remember that part of our lives ‘cause it was pretty... we used to do some pretty bad stuff out there out in the wild.	Aaron

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well-- [crosstalk]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait, was he Klaarg originally?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then he came here and switched to Daniel and went back to Klaarg, is that what’s up?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s hard to explain, you might-- you may wanna ask Lucas about it, it’s kinda-- the specifics-	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We totes will, he’s our buddy, I hugged him once, he gave us some Oolong, then he joined in a wacky racers thing with us, it was great--	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] No problemo!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we didn’t kill him or anything.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Didn’t fight with him.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] He’s fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Nope.	Merle

NON-CONTENT			Wha-- okay, now listen--	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Why do you keep saying that he is?	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Here are the two ways people say that someone’s not dead: [normally] “Oh, he’s not dead” [exaggerated] “He’s not deeaad!” You’re doing the second one.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You’re falling into that second category, hard.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You’re leaning into that category.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	He’s not dead, he’s very much alive.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	He’s not [with strange inflection] dead?	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			You’re so bad at inflection.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			I like that one ‘cause it betrays the actuality of the situation, which is: I don’t know.	Justin

NON-CONTENT			Um-- [crosstalk]	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bugbears.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Tell us about this other group you encountered before us.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Aw, yeah, they were really rude!	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They came through, and we offered them, y’know, some tea, and we just... y’know, we asked how they were doin’ and they wanted to get by, and head inward-- towards the inner chambers in the lab.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And we’re like, we can’t let that happen, of course, so we had sort of a disagreement--	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, pardon?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, sorry?	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We, um... totally gotcha, why- why can you not let-- hypothetically, a group of people pass by to get in?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, well that’s, like, sort of our thing, y’know-- we do our jobs around the place, but we’re also... we are still bugbears.	Aaron
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, so we’re like, really big, so we also do some light security work, um, for the lab as well.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Y’know, we can’t really let folks--	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, what if Lucas said it was cool?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I guess that would be fine?	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He-- he didn’t tell us it was cool with this last group though, so uh--	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well I…  [crosstalk]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was sort of a kerfuffle?	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There was a lil’ dwarf guy that attacked us, so we gave him a lil’-- a lil’ piece of our minds, there was a lizard lady, and she threw some sort of smoke bomb at us-- and we all went to dreamy-dream town.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They sound like dicks.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[mumbled agreement from Merle]	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, I hated ‘em.	John
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you hear me?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Come in, Lucas--	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, okay, I guess you’ve sorta found out about one of my less ethical sort of experiments.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um...	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It sounds fine.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They seem great.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Yeah, they’re really sweethearts.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, they really are-- they’re great-- they have these, um-- these inhibitors-- these inhibitor chips, in their brains, that I...	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I was trying to come up with a way to like, have people that would do some help for me around the lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Ohhhh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But also protect the lab from attackers, so I…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Slavery, right?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, [sighs] I guess, kind of, yeah a little bit, but they-- I mean, they seem genuinely happy, and y’know, they didn’t like being... all violent--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] So this is why we couldn’t charm Klaarg again.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah I saw, I watched what you guys did with Klaarg-- when I watched you on the races, and when I saw him pop up, I was a little bit surprised-- I gotta know, what did you guys do to him down there?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[slowly] We charmed him.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He’s our buddy.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You used, like a charm spell on him?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Klaarg, or as he was known here, Daniel Butler-- he was my butler-- he, um--	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas, you gotta get better at that.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			C’mon.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			A little subtlety.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk] Aw, no, I thought it was-- I thought it was cute.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, um, he ran off-- he got into a little scuffle with his sister, and he bumped his head, and I think it disabled the inhibitor chip, and he had a freak-out.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And he-- he ran off and escaped, and all I can think is that when you charmed him, somehow the wires got crossed in his brain?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			As it turns out, if you, like, inhibit all the aggression in a bugbear, they’re actually very sweet.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, and so I that think he’s a bit on the fritz, Taako.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, right!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, okay, now I remember-- I charmed him the first time we met him, to turn him into like, Kelsey Grammer?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Mhm.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think the odds are actually pretty good that he’s, maybe gonna be charmed by you forever, kind of like... on and off.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Cool!	Magnus
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He can join a nation of podcast listeners, [laughter] in that particular affliction.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, so, Luco-- need you to pass on to these, uh... these hugbears, that it’s totally cool for us to continue on our way unmolested.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah sure, uh, hey guys, you just gotta let ‘em pass, okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They’re trying to get in-- into the middle.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Before we go, will you tell us just just a little bit more about the scuffle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Was there a problem with the scuffle?	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh yeah, like, we were-- we don’t wanna be rude, we try to be real nice here, as-- as much as we can, but yeah these-- these three, um.	Jamie
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Honestly it was just the dwarf guy that was mostly sorta causin’ all the trouble, honestly reminds me of back in my day, um, one time a guy came into my cave and I just killed ‘em!	Jamie

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you go through the airlock, before you actually get into the med bay, you reach a sign that says, “Decontamination Chamber,” and as you open it up, it's actually a pretty small chamber that has some medical equipment in it, and what looks like an observation bay, but this whole room has also been completely crystallized.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Ah, bummer.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you pass through that, and through another airlock, you do actually make it into the med bay, and there you see Lucas, for the first time since you met him in the voidfish's chambers.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	No.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			It’s, uh...	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	The bleeding starts to slow a little bit, Merle, you actually wake up a little bit, you gain a little bit of consciousness as you feel this needle go into you—	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What has been goin' ON out there?	Lucas

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, he uh-	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I got disarmed.	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's pretty good.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			He started to crystallize, we were chopping on a door and magicking a door, then we heard Noelle scream, then we turned around, his hand was turning to crystal, and then his arm was turning to crystal, and I heroically - valiantly - chopped his arm off, against my wishes— he begged me— and I cut his arm off so that he wouldn't all crystal.	Magnus

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t- We can't get out of here, we can't get out of here until we manage to stop the base from sinking into the sea and crystallizing the whole world.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Did you forget why we're here in the first place?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			'Cause I— well, I—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's been like four episodes, my dude.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's because I fucked up an experiment pretty bad.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But we— that's not, this, the arm thing's not on me, I don't think!	Lucas

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I heard all of that, um, okay...	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And she is holding a potted plant with these four wooden shoots, it looks like, coming out of it.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is going to be great.	Lucas

NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But as you taste it, and as you drink it, you see this wooden— these four wooden shoots hanging off of this belt kind of come to a standstill and start to wrap around each other and tie around each other, and they form what looks like kind of a crude four-fingered arm.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so biology's not my specialty, but this is definitely gonna work.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is a plant called soulwood, and it's a psychically tuned plant that can resonate with certain people that resonate with them, and it can sort of change its biology based on the whims of other living creatures.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Merle, from what I understand, plants are kind of your specialty, um, so—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Romantically.	Magnus

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So I guess it all worked out!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, everything worked out for the best!	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Worked out fine.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I want you to feel completely off the hook, Magnus.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And then Magnus and Merle engage in a very complicated like high five secret handshake so he can test out the hand, we do the Shimmy Shimmy Cocoa Pop, the Bureau handshake—	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, as you do the secret Merle and Magnus handshake, Merle, you feel like it is not a big deal to move this thing at all.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It takes maybe a little bit to become as dextrous with it as you were your original OG dwarf hand, but yeah, you have pretty good control over this soulwood arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And it actually like kind of curls up towards you and gives you a big thumbs-up as if to say, hey!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	I'm your arm now!	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Wow!	Clint

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[Travis laughs] It's the tree!	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	I want it in the canon that Magnus is actually like a little bit jealous of his sweet new wooden arm.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Not out loud, mind you, but just quietly to himself.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	And I would like it in canon that Magnus can kiss my Kenny Chesney tattoo.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Fair.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	All of this is fair.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Can you imagine what delectable torture that would be though, for Magnus, to have a tree on his arm that he cannot split.	Justin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah, true…	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Well, he can.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Can Magnus make a tree even he can’t split?	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	So in terms of mechanics, Merle, you now have just a permanent disadvantage on sleight of hand rolls.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	That's just— your days of having good sleight of hand rolls are behind you.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	My days of having any good rolls are behind me!	Clint
NON-CONTENT			But!	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You can now control this hand separately from yourself.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	You can take it off, chuck it, control it like you would normally, [Travis: What?]	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	like your hand, only you can control it remotely.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Awesome.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So it gave him superpowers, basically.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Great.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	More so than the magic he could already wield, you know, summoning angels and all that.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Magnus cuts both his legs off.	Griffin

ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Juice me up!	Griffin

STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[snickering]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so we don't have a lot of time for you to get acclimated to your new arm, so you're gonna have to figure it out on the fly, but before we get out there, you're gonna need to recharge your suits.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Noelle says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That's right!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh gosh!	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Sorry, I completely blanked.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And a little compartment opens up and a tank pops out that looks very much like the tank of spray that they plugged into the chamber when you first got sprayed down to null-suit yourselves.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And Lucas slips into his null suit and plugs the tank into the chamber, and he's like,	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, everybody, pile on in!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It's time to recharge!	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And I guess very awkwardly, because there's more of you now, you're doing like a Real World/Road Rules like, how many co-eds can we fit into a phone booth challenge... you all get coated in another layer of null-suit juice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The meters, you have these little panels on your wrist that are showing how much energy you have left in your null suits, are completely full up now.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And everybody gets all sprayed down.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			And may I say, in Amazon reviews, I'm giving the null suits originally one thumbs down…	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			[laughs] That's not how Amazon reviews work.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			I couldn't pass up a thumb joke.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Oh, that's— good point.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			We're gonna have a lot of those now, I bet.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey Lucas, while we're all showering together…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	"What is that?"	Clint
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When Merle—	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You're standing on my thigh, which is weird.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Thank you for the boost.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When Merle mentioned a British guy, did that ring any bells for you?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I swear, guys?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The lying stuff?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is over now.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have no fucking idea what—	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But you realize that like this is an all-audio medium, so all I can do is ask questions, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can't look around and observe…	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I get it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, if you want, I can tell you all about the compact…	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That'd be cool!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It'll be easier if I show you the Cosmoscope.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Can you guys— are you guys ready to roll?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Magnus
NON-CONTENT			Uh... [clears throat]	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[voice strained and breaking] Yeah.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah... still in a lot of pain, but okay.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[voice breaking a lot] Let's do it.	Taako
NON-CONTENT			Justin, I wanna hear your—	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	The role of Taako today will be played by a ghost.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	The Cold and Flu version of Taako should be interesting.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Yeah.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Taako silently nods in agreement.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You guys make your way out of the med bay and through the decontamination chamber back into the central hub.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This room is kind of a mess because the crystal golem started to form in here and kind of fucked shit up, as he was like breaking pieces of crystal off.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And you make your way into the door that you saw earlier that was labeled 'The Cosmoscope.'	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And as you pass through the airlock into the Cosmoscope you enter into what you assume to be a pretty large chamber, although it is like, completely pitch black in here.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Save for a pillar of light which is illuminating what looks like a circular disk that is kind of free-floating in the middle of the room, facing you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And uh, Lucas walks into the back of the room, into the darkness.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see him get out a flashlight and you can see he's messing with some sort of lectern back there…	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Time for scary stories!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the tale of the... [stalling] old... sailor's... mummy!	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	No, he flips some switches on this lectern and you see an image pop up on this disk, and it looks like the lab that you are currently standing in, as seen from above, from outside of the lab.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, I’m about to get into some pretty heavy concepts.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, I’m probably going to blow your whole mind and just kinda reshape the way you think about existence and stuff.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So if it ever gets to be too much or you have any questions, please feel free to stop me, okay?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay wait stop: you’re blowing my mind.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Boy, this is gonna take forever, I bet.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Let’s take this slow.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			My whole life, I have been obsessed with the concepts of taxonomy and hierarchy.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			For everything that exists, there’s always a bigger thing that contains it.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			There’s always someone cooler than you, right?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s one way of putting it, yeah.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So there’s always a bigger thing that has a bigger thing that contains it, and so on and so forth, repeated on to just inconceivable degrees.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way down.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Turtles all the way up.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Bigger turtles.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So…	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he points to this disk in the middle of the room, and he says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, so this is my lab.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We can go way deeper on, like, the micro scale.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			To, like, elementary particles and stuff like that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But for the lightweight version of this demonstration, let’s start here.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s my lab.	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Got it.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he holds up two index fingers, and does, like, an iPhone pinch-- pinches them together, and the image pans out.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see it zoom out, and now you can see the Stillwater Sea underneath his lab.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay so here it is floating over the Stillwater Sea --	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he pinches the screen again.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s that sea in relation to the neighboring landmasses, and here’s the whole continent, Faerûn.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s our whole world, Abeir-Toril.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			How’d you do that?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Just bear with me.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re gonna go way way further.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: What?]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s our solar system.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: Huh??]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Here’s the local interstellar cloud, [Magnus: What?]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			the local bubble, the local arm, the galaxy…	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And as he’s doing this, you’re seeing the entire galaxy, spiraling.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s beautiful.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You’ve never seen anything quite like it.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And here’s the local group -- [Magnus: I’ve seen it.]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			...Oh.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Laughs] Okay.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I wanna actually ask you guys about that here in a minute, but here’s the local group, the local cluster, the local supercluster, and so on and so forth, until… Here!	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s all just a collar on a cat!	Travis
NON-CONTENT			[Laughing] It’s, uh, yeah.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the observable universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is everything we know, every place we’ve ever been, every person we’ve ever met, every place anyone’s ever been, is in here.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But more importantly, so are the immutable rules that govern the people, places and things inside of this universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Things like gravity and thermodynamics and arcane interactions.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And all that stuff, all that matter and energy and the rules that govern it, comprise this.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Our universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You guys are just a handful of people who have ever seen the observable universe before, so.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s pretty cool, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, is there like a guest book we need to sign, or...?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Deep voice] Hey, listen, uh, listen.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What if I was to take one step past what you’ve shown me here?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, can I say something?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s up?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve just made me very, very happy.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He walks to the back of the room-	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And also, just to clarify, horny.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[crosstalk]	Taako
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It all ties together.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			- and also, you have a deep desire to give me a lot of money.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’ve made me very horny.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	–he says, and he flips a switch on that lectern, and the whole room lights up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the disk in the middle that you were just looking at is made of some sort of dark, bluish-green material, in a perfect circle with some silvery trim all around it, and this disk is levitating.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But you realize, as the lights go up, this room is filled with these disks.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[MUSIC: The Cosmoscope starts]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they’re all arrayed in orbit around this central disk in rings around it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there’s ten other of these disks in the room and they’re all different colors -- bright reds and oranges and greens and blues and whites -- and they’re all displaying a wide array of scenes of impossible things.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	You look into this red disk, [Magnus: Like what?]	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	you see a world that looks kind of like the world, if the world was made completely out of lava and fire.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then there’s a blue disk where it’s just a giant ocean, a world made of water and ice.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where millions and millions of these living lights just float weightlessly through the air and worlds where oceans of magical energy wash up on shores made of these brilliant white sands--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	There’s a name for that one.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It’s Ibiza.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see-	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a world where everything's the same except everybody's got mustaches…	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	retcon	NO	You see, well, no, that’s not one of them, but you see all of these, like, incredible worlds and you don’t know where to look--	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Uh, I would.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I would look at Buffet Planet back there, couple planets back.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Lucas says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, to answer your question, this is the next thing that’s bigger.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is our planar system.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, this, this disk, that you see, that represents our observable universe, this is actually our plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is the prime material plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We’re smack-dab in the middle of the planar universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And each of these are different planes of existence, and they, they each produce unique energies and they share these energies.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They inform the material and physical make-up of, of, of each other.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They each have connections, some are more tenuous than others.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But these make up the real existence, uh -- each plane having its own sort of energies and rules.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This, this is what’s bigger than the universe.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then what’s bigger than that?	Merle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Good question.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Thank you.	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, let’s start with this: There are six building block planes, right?	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And these, he points to these disks that are on the outermost ring away from the prime material plane disk that’s in the middle of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he goes:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So you’ve got your elemental planes: Fire, air, water, earth.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then you got the planes of light and shadow.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Magnus: Heart?]	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Taako, certainly, you probably know a little bit about these during your studies at Wizard U.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[low and raspy voice] Yeah, I’ve gotten balls-deep in some of those other planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I think he’s got a secret room in one of ‘em.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When I use Blink, I get all up in those other planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s right.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			When you use Blink, you end up in the ethereal plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You didn’t list that amongst your planes.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, there’s more.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m gonna run through them.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But if you actually look --	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You can actually see underneath the disk that you were looking at first, where you’re looking at your own universe, you actually see another disk underneath it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And he’s like:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That one is the ethereal plane, and it’s kind of like a filter.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like where the raw energies of the rest of the planes are kinda filtered into the prime material plane so it’s not just like, everything’s on fire or drowning all the time.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So yeah, anyway, that’s the seventh, and then we got the planes that sort of inform the energies of life itself, like the plane of magic where magic energy is born.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then on the opposite end of that, you see there’s the plane of thought which is the source of logic and reason and emotion.	Lucas
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So the boring one.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Well, as you actually look into the plane of thought, which is this deep green emerald mirror, you see similar scenes to the things that you saw in the compact, Magnus.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see a large, wide, gray road with a bunch of vehicles just sort of sitting stuck on it.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Metal dragons!	Magnus
NON-CONTENT			Yeah!	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see scenes like you saw in the compact.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	So this plane is where all the creativity and energy for this world comes from.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	The creation.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s like where the home of logical thought is.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s why I call it the plane of thought.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Show me Donald Trump!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t... know quite who that is.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Although, the fact that you guys make so many references to this world makes me think you have to have spent some time there at some point.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I have a little house there.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I can’t tell if you’re joking, which is like, kinda par for the course.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Anyway, there’s the other higher planes, there’s the celestial plane, which is inhabited by the beings that I guess some people would consider deities.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	There’s the meat plane, the vegetable plane, the dairy plane, the breads plane…	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Soluble fats plane…	Justin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, but you only wanna visit that one sometimes!	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plain plane, that's not very exciting.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	The plane plane, that's just full of planes.	Justin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And the plain plane plane with all these plain planes in the plane.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Yeah, you gotta be careful with that one.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’ve been working on a new version of the food pyramid, to kinda educate the people of Faerûn, but it’s kinda like a cube?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it’s for people who like to party.	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh, hey, listen, I gotta be honest.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			From me to you, that sounds dope as hell.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[continuing from before the comedic tangent] And then the prime material plane, the ethereal plane, you know about those.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And then the astral plane, which is where our unconscious forms -- our souls -- retire when we die here in the prime material plane.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	Is Merle’s arm there?	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Wait a minute!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That goes completely against my theology.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is there a Pan plane?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Please respect his beliefs.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, Pan probably kicks it in the celestial plane.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Actually, as he was talking about the astral plane, you realize he’s talked about 12 different planes but there are only 11 in the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	He says:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			The astral plane -- so anyway, let me explain.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Crystals, certain types of gemstones, if grown into a perfect circle -- they can’t be cut!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			If you cut it, it doesn’t work.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			They have to be naturally grown in a perfect circle -- resonate with the different planes of existence.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			With the twelve planes that form our planar system, right?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, everybody knows that.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, that’s 101.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Literally nobody outside this family knows that, until now.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I knew it.	Merle
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[crosstalk]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			We talked about it yesterday.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You remember that, Merle?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[Frustrated] Yeah, okay, so-	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, when I wasn’t speaking to you.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[lower voice] Hey, listen, little man, these guys are just being braggadocious.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Don’t let them rattle your chain.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Go ahead with what you were saying.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I’m loving all this.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lay it down.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, anyway, my great-grandfather found a crystal, just like that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And it was a perfect emerald disk that had just grown like that naturally in nature.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And through that, he was able to see into the plane of thought.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And using that, we may have gained a little bit of inspiration for our inventions here in the prime material plane.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Kind of cheating, I guess, if you wanna call it that.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Is it possible that through tampering and connecting with these planes, that you might have gotten the attention of something that we shouldn’t have?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			[instantly] Definitely not!	Lucas
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[laughter]	stage
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That really kinda feels like what’s going on here.	Magnus
NON-GAME_RELATED			Can you guys give me a minute?	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			Sorry.	Griffin
NON-GAME_RELATED			One sec.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[beeps, then a slamming noise]	stage
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s gotta go write a new story.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			He’s like, “Uh, no no no!	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Give me twenty minutes!”	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Like when the producers of Lost pretended that it wasn’t about purgatory the whole time.	Justin
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was?	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was.	Justin and Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			It was about purgatory?	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Oh, I thought it was inside like a snowglobe thing and it was, like --	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Here’s the thing, Dad, the tricky thing is even when it wasn’t about purgatory, it was.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			‘Cause that’s how purgatory works.	Travis
NON-GAME_RELATED			Ahhh.	Clint
NON-GAME_RELATED			Hey, I’m back, sorry.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So, yeah, my family [sigh], we’ve sort of led the Industrial Revolution in this world for generations now because of that mirror.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			And so because of that, my mother, Maureen, started to sort of come up with this idea of how we can create other mirrors into other worlds.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But it’s really hard to do, you know?	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Because you can’t, like I said, you can’t cut these gemstones to create these mirrors.	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, if it was easy, everyone would do it, you know what I mean?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Exactly!	Lucas
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Everybody would have their own extra-planar sort of telescope situation.	Lucas
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Killian’s actually getting a little short-tempered about all this.	Griffin

IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Guys, remember?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yeah!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah!	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, boy.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Quantum Leap, oh boy indeed.	Taako
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Noelle takes a stab at the red hand scanner and can’t seem to do anything with it.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Now do the robot room!	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, okay, okay!	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She puts her—she puts one of her appendages on the green hand scanner and cracks it and that large, large, large door slides open and a gust of smoke and fog pours out of this cavernous robotics workshop.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It is a humongous room with a number of really just gigantic pieces of fabrication machinery all around it and it’s all feeding onto this assembly line that connects all these different pieces of machinery onto a central conveyor belt that is running into a tunnel at the end of the room.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And there are tons of these scrapped robots lying all over the place.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			This room is like—	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus goes crazy!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Just pulling arms left and right!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Pops an arm boner!	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, this would be a good place for you to do that ‘cause there’s hundreds and hundreds of robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	But they’re just, like, laying all hither and yon.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	This place is as messy—it’s as messy as Lucas’s private quarters.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, so there’s a bunch of these scrapped robots all over, just all piled up.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What you notice about some of the robots, some of the more sophisticated looking ones, is they have little windows in their torsos.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And inside those little windows you can see what looks like a big, glass fuse kinda similar to the one that Noelle has in the middle of her chassis behind another window.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And Noelle’s just kinda, like, lookin’ at these robots with these fuses in their chests and is kinda like, movin’ em around with her arm and just kinda looking ‘em over.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[whispering] They’re her brothers and sisters!	Clint
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle, any thoughts you’d like to share with us in this moment?	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, I haven’t… I haven’t actually been in here in a while, I don’t.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t know what most of these are— I don’t know what’s goin’ on with most of these.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Uh-huh.	Magnus
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			But we should—we should—let’s get a move on, let’s go through—that tunnel is the robot delivery system so we can go through there and that should be able to get us into the main experiment chamber.	Noelle
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	[crosstalk] She sounds sad.	Travis
MECHANICS		NO	[crosstalk] I'm gonna run a Perc— I'm gonna roll a Perception check to see if any of these robots stick out to me in particular.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	And I'm gonna roll an Insight check on Noelle.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Okay.	Griffin
MECHANICS		NO	Sixteen for me.	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I did not do great.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Yeah, the only thing you can kinda put together, Taako, is that not all of these robots have these little fuses built into them and the ones that do have more sort of vaguely humanoid appearances?	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	To sort of compare them, the ones that you see all laying around with the fuses, as compared to Noelle, like, Noelle, like I said earlier’s kinda like rough-shod, she’s kinda put together of all these different component parts, constituent parts.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	A lot of these robots are kind of approaching a sort of human look to them.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	And you can kinda put together that, like, if anything, Noelle was sort of a prototype to whatever these are.	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Hmm.	Justin
MECHANICS		NO	I rolled a 2.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	lore_history_backstory	NO	Okay, you—Noelle is a robot.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Got it.	Travis
NON-CONTENT			Can—	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			Justin: [laughing]	stage
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	YES	Can—maybe—can we maybe take some of those fuses?	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	They’re actually like, embedded in the torsos of most of these things so you’d have to take, like, the whole thing and it would be.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	It would be pretty, um, cumbersome.	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Hey—hey, Noelle, I noticed that you have a sort of fuse-looking thing, similar to some of these other robots.	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			What’s—what’s that all about?	Taako
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I mean, it’s just one of my power units.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I don’t really—I don’t actually—I don’t actually know that much about my own sorta, y’know, my own sorta machinery, but, um, yeah.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Lucas has always just told me that it’s just another power source inside of me, so.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Um, we should, guys, we should really get a move on—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			No, wait, wait.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			—we don’t have that long.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Noelle?	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Look at me.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Look at me, Noelle.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah?	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			I'm lookin’.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You’re better than any of these damn junky robots.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, I'm the only one floatin’, I guess.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Yeah, alright.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			So don’t be lookin’ at them and gettin’ sad!	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Okay, well—	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			You are my special angel.	Merle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Well, thanks.	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	actions	NO	Magnus goes through the door on Garyl.	Travis
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Garyl, onward!	Magnus
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	Okay, yeah, you move into the tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	It’s actually dark as fuck in here, there’s, like, no lighting whatsoever.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And this conveyor belt is not running, there’s, like, nothing running in this room, it’s—it’s— quiet.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	As you go through, Noelle actually powers on a little flashlight in her body and is helping you all look around.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	YES	What color is it?	Clint
NON-CONTENT			Uhh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Lavender.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	You really caught me off-guard with that.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I know.	Clint
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	But you recovered nicely.	Clint
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And yeah, she’s walking you through this tunnel.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And it’s still quiet, although you hear what sounds like sort of a low-pitched wind coming from in front of you as you move down this tunnel.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[wind blowing]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	She says,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Alright, I should be able to get us there, there’s a few twists and turns we need to make, but, um.	Noelle
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Shouldn’t be too complicated.	Noelle
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And—almost as soon as she says that, you see a light in front of you.	Griffin
STAGE_DIRECTIONS			[ominous electric machinery noises]	stage
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	What looks like a floating ball of light in front of you that appears from around a corner.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And then you see a second, and then a third ball of light.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	You see three floating balls of light and they fly at you fast.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	But they don’t collide with you, they just kinda pass over and around you and as they do, you hear what sounds like, this sound of like, men, like, moaning sadly as they—as they fly by you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And move through the tunnel back into the robot factory.	Griffin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh, snap!	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I might’ve just figured out what those fuses are for.	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	From behind you, where the lights went, you see three shapes appear in the tunnel behind you.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And they are three humanoid robots.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	One is sort of massive, massively built, kind of gorilla-like.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	Another is much more slender with a, what looks like a cannon for an arm.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	description	NO	And another one is very short and has what appears to be, like, a bunch of wires sticking out of it.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And they all run at you and once they get within sort of spitting distance, they stop and you hear all three kind of laugh.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And one of them goes,	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god, I can’t believe it’s you guys!	Maarvey
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh my god, I can’t believe I get a second stab at this!	Maarvey
NON-CONTENT			Uh,	Griffin
NON-CONTENT			Huh?	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	That’s the one, the big gorilla-lookin’ one says that.	Griffin
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the one with the cannon for an arm goes:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			Oh, yes!	Magic Brian
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			This is going to be a lovely little rematch, isn’t it?	Magic Brian
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Oh snap, Magic Brian!	Travis
NARRATION_AND_DESCRIPTION	events	NO	And the short one with the wires sticking out of it says, uh:	Griffin
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			That’s right, motherfuckers.	Jenkins
IN-CHARACTER_DIALOGUE			It’s time for round 2.	Jenkins
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	I said I'd smell you later.	Travis
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Consider yourselves	Justin
ABOUT_THE_GAME	comments	NO	Smelled!	Clint & Justin
